  Word from Eric:


  <blockquote>

  There is actually no code in the OAuth enabled desktop that has any awareness
  of how federation or user-authentication happens at Google.  In the generic
  case, the desktop app just tells Google it wants an OAuth token for "someones"
  mail/calendar API.  In the more advanced case, it tells Google it wants an
  OAuth token for "someone in the domain acme.com."  That seperation/indirection
  is very powerful in our opinion because the user can be authentication using
  any means, and the federation (if it happens) can use any protocol/mechanism. 
  So we don't need to update the desktop app in the future if we add more
  federation mechanisms, or authentication mechanisms.

  </blockquote>


  I've amended my flow accordingly.
