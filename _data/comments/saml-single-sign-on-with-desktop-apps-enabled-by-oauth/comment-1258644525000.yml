  Pat, it seems the only connection between SAML &amp; OAuth is in your Step 1,
  ie in which Outlook 'invokes the browser with a SAML SP URL, including the
  request token as a query parameter. '


  What param is Google using for this?


  After this, SAML seems completely separable from the OAuth piece, ie its just
  how Google authenticates the user before authz.


  I'm also exploring mechanisms by which SAML protocol messages can carry Oauth
  params/tokens
