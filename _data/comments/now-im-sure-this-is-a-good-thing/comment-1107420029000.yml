  I followed your "What's Your Nerd Score" link and took the test. My score was
  86, a "high-nerd" rating on its scale. I am trying to interpret the result. If
  that means that I am in top 14% nerdiest people in the world - boy, that's not
  much to be proud of, given how small % of general population is qualified to
  be Sun engineer. If, on the other hand, I am in  top 14% of all people who
  took the test, who presumably did so to find out how just nerdy he/she is -
  well, I can live with that...
