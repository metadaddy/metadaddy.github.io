  In the scenario you describe, there would need to be a way to send back the
  reply - if the only identity were the location, then the weather service would
  have to broadcast the response to every subscriber in that location.  In this
  case there is an originating mobile number that is part of the request as
  well.</p><p>

  Perhaps you are thinking of a scenario where there are multiple tiers - a
  portal that maps your mobile cell into a geographic area, which then contacts
  an external weather service over a  traditional connection, provides that
  location area as input and reformats the response forecast into an SMS
  message.  This would not be very different from a stock quote service that
  sends back an SMS message with price information based on the stock portfolio
  you've configured with your service provider.
