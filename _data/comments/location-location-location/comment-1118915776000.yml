  Pat, I think the position outlined in the comments is correct now; "is located
  at x" is a predicate which doesn't necessarily carry any identity information.
  The only way to avoid having to broadcast the weather data is to have some
  other piece of identity data (i.e. the subscriber number).

  <br />

  The assertion "The man in the corner is my father" may be true (if your father
  is in the corner), but "is in the corner" would only be a general assertion of
  your father's identity under somewhat weird circumstances (i.e. if the only
  way to be in that corner is to be your father).

  <br />

  Off the top of my head, the only working example I can think of is "The man
  sitting on that chair is the author of one of my text-books". That sentence,
  spoken in the right place, would always and uniquely identify the philosopher
  Jeremy Bentham... but only because he's been stuffed and mounted in University
  College London. (!)  (He donated his body to science and they took him
  literally... ;^)
