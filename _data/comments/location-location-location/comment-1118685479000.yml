  Ahhh - Alan - thanks. I think you're right. The user's identity is 'anonymous'
  (well, apart from their cellphone number), and location is a context
  attribute.

  <br />

  So, to take a common (non-location) use case, with Shibboleth, if I SSO from
  one the <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">University of
  Warwick</a> to <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">University of
  York</a>, I am anonymous (no subject attributes), but I have a <i>context</i>
  attribute that says I'm a student at the University of Warwick. York can then
  provide me services based on that information and its relationship with
  Warwick.

  <br />

  Similarly, one can conceive of services that would use location rather than
  university attendance to authorize access. My cellphone provider asserts my
  location, and service providers can provide me with services based on that
  location and their relationship with my cellphone provider. Okay - makes
  sense.

  <br />

  I still think there's a pretty fuzzy line between subject and context
  attributes, though...
