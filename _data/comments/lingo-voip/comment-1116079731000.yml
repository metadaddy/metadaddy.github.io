  Superpat,

  Just signed up for Vonage with a Linksys WRT54Gp2 and want to change to Lingo
  for the Western Europe calls.  Do you know how I can change while still using
  the Linksys WRT54GP2 for Lingo?  Do not see retailers offering Lingo packages
  with wireless routers in my area.

  Thanks,

  JB
