  How is it that expression of yours, been there, done that :) <br />

  Location is one of the main basis of ISP auth here in Portugal. Of course
  that, for an ISP "location" is defined has being inside our outside the ISP's
  Network. I can certify that this feature not only is possible but is in
  prodution for some monthes now. When we deploy AM in GSM Operators, Location
  will be defined by the cel they're connected to (like what's the nearest sushy
  bar ranking 3 stars or more). <br />

  I believe that the term "identity" if limited to the user's name (or even to
  an user) is comming short of the actual potential of this solutions. Identity
  can (and should) be applied to any and to all factors that will be used to
  discriminate services (Identity applied to ILM).
