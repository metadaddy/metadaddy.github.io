  <p>Hi Pat!<p>Regarding:

  <blockquote>

  "what could it mean to have an OpenID that says you are an employee of Sun
  Microsystems (or, for that matter, any company)?"

  </blockquote>

  <p>In my opinion it does not matter whether the OpenID provider that says you
  are an employee of Sun is the OpenID provider at Sun. For a OpenID consumer it
  is totally irrelevant whether it is the official Sun OpenID Provider or if it
  is a free random open registration provider somewhere on the net. And this is
  where OpenID's goal is totally different from SAML thinking, and this is also
  where OpenID often is misunderstood.

  <p>That said, what you are gaining, and what is totally awsome for Sun
  employees is that you will get SSO between internal services and all those
  random openid consumers. (off course if the openid provider is the same as
  your saml idp).

  <p>I tried to sketch some of my ideas of what happens, and why, to <a
  href="http://rnd.feide.no/2007/03/23/openid-and-federations/"
  rel="nofollow">put up OpenID interfaces to existing SAML IdPs</a>, but I am no
  good at writing.
