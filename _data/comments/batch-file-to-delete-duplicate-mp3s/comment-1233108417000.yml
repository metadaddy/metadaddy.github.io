  <p>Alright, since i'm getting emailed every time you add a comment i'm going
  to intervene.  Mr. Patterson is being very patient even though it's clear that
  whatever problem you have is completely out of the scope of what his script is
  meant to do. Anyway, it's really pretty difficult to figure out what you're
  trying to do by your description.  What exactly is a 'unit of desktop'?  I
  highly suggest you do a little more research (try google) before you ask any
  more questions. Here's a hint: search for ways to find files in Windows
  Desktop Search.  Using a batch script sounds like it might be dangerous for
  you.</p>
