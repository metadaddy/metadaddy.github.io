  Hi

  I am trying to achieve SSO and evaluating opn SSO project. However I am not
  able to understand this product as there are no documents. Please can you
  point me where I can find detailed documents for this project.

  I tried to refer document of Access Manager 7 on sun.com/docs, However the
  things described there is not available here. For example developers guide
  mentions about few client code and client war. The same is not available here.
  The openssodemo.war says that it includes both opensso.war and few extra
  client directories, however there is no README or Sample code or anything else
  which says how SSO is achieved.

  I am sorry if I sounded bit frustrated here, actually I have wasted quite some
  time on this project, I started with evaluating Sun Identity manager …… When I
  downloaded the project on Sun,  all I got is Web Agent which is available as
  Access manager download. While going through the documents of Web Agent
  (called as Access Manager on Sun.com) I found that Access Manager is something
  totally different. I tried hard to find Access Manager and after doing some
  research I found its now opensso project. It is not at all mentioned on Sun
  Website that this project is now open source. And when I came here and read
  documents I found nothing concrete in terms of sample codes etc.

  I will really Appreciate if you can help me regarding this issue.

  Thanks

  Nipun
