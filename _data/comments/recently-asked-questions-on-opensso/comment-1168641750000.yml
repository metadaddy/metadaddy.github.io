  Hi David, addressing your second question first, HADB is part of Sun's
  Application Server. OpenSSO's session failover feature uses a
  container-independent session persistence mechanism based on Berkeley DB and
  Sun's Message Queue.</p><p>On the the first question, I guess you've already
  read the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-5899/6n7uuth8k?a=view"
  rel="nofollow">Implementing Session Failover</a> document. If so, could you
  post your question to the users@opensso.dev.java.net mailing list (you can <a
  href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList"
  rel="nofollow">sign up here</a>)? The folks there should be able to guide
  you.</p>
