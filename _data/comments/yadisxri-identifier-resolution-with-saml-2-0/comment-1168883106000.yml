  Hi Chema, the service provider/relying party does indeed need to fetch
  metadata for each identity provider (just as an OpenID relying party needs to
  dereference the user's URL or i-name for each login), but it need not keep it
  persistently - the metadata can just be discarded at the end of the login. The
  service provider can choose to allow all identity providers or only a given
  set, just as in 'classic' OpenID.
