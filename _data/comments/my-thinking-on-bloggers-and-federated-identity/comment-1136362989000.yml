  Pat, you can find more about Virtual Personality in the link that James
  McGovern provided you:

  www.virtualrights.org

  A Virtual Personality is a new human right *totally related* with the Liberty
  Alliance initiative. You can find more here:

  http://virtualrights.org/files/Congress%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Costa%20Rica.doc

  Also here:

  You can also exchange about Virtual Personality with Robin Wilton.

  Most probably there will be involvement of Liberty Alliance members (Robin
  Wilton, Brett McDowell, Andrew Shikiar, Scott Cantor, others...) and
  institutions with the development of this new human right in 2006 and beyond.

  Please also note that the ID Gang has not analyzed Virtual Personality, which
  is a Constitutional amendment proposal. It is a legal development and not a
  technical development. The editor of the Lexicon is the person who edits the
  status of the terms.

  Best regards,

  Jaco
