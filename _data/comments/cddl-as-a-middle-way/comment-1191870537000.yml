  <p>Thanks for unfolding the questions and the assumptions behind them.
  Thinking of CDDL as a middle way between Apache and GPL demonstrates its
  potential use, for software development communities. However, I think this is
  a multi-dimensional &quot;middle,&quot; i.e. one dimension has to do with
  availability of source for what is done, another with greater possibilities
  for distribution economies. Best wishes, -m.</p>
