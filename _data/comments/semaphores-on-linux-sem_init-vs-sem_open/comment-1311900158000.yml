  Hi Nilesh, it looks like your code is missing a couple of lines, but I think I
  understand your question. The answer is that the order in which the two
  processes enter the critical section is not guaranteed; only the fact that
  they won't be there at the same time. What are you trying to do?


  BTW - it's better to create a gist and post the URL here - then your code
  won't get eaten by WordPress - https://gist.github.com/
