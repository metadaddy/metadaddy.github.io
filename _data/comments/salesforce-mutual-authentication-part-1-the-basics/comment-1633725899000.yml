  Hi Bini - as I mentioned in my reply to Kumar, this area of Salesforce is
  quite confusing, and not well documented. Mutual Authentication certificates
  are used by Salesforce to verify clients calling the Salesforce APIs. The
  client uses its private key in the TLS handshake and Salesforce verifies it
  against the certificate chain you uploaded.


  You are in the opposite situation - you want to load a private key and
  certificate chain into Salesforce so that when your Apex code does a callout,
  Salesforce can use the private key in the TLS handshake and ADP can verify it
  against the certificate it has on record. I believe you need to create a
  keystore in Java Keystore (JKS) format containing your private key and
  certificate chain and import it into Salesforce using the <strong>Import from
  Keystore</strong> button in the <strong>Certificates</strong> section of the
  Certificate and Key Management page.
