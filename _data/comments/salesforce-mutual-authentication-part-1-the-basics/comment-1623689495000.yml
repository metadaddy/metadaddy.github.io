  Hi Prem! You have to create a signing key and submit the public key to one of
  the <a href="https://login.salesforce.com/cacerts.jsp" rel="nofollow ugc">CA's
  trusted by Salesforce</a>. You CANNOT use a self-signed certificate. The
  details vary according to which CA you use. I've used GoDaddy in the past - <a
  href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/apache-generate-csr-certificate-signing-request-5269"
  rel="nofollow ugc">their instructions are here</a>. You generate the key and
  certificate signing request (CSR), keep the key (it's your secret!) and submit
  the CSR to the CA. They will issue the certificate as a PEM file that you can
  download. NOTE - you need an SSL certificate, not a code-signing certificate.
