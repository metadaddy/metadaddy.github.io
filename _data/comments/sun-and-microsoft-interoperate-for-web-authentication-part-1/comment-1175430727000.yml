  Hi

  Great article but do you know of a similar article that explain what to do
  with webservices in .net .asmx and Sun access manager authentication (SSO). I
  have a windows application in .net 2.0 that need to consume an intranet
  Asp.net 2.0 Webservice on IIS protected by access manager.

  thanx

  Itzik
