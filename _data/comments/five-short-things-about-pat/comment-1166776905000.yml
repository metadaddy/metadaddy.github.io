  Pat mate,

  <br /><br />

  It's so tempting to abuse this post.

  <br /><br /><br />

  I'm sitting in my mountain bat cave now thinking of the things you've done to
  me after a couple bottles of Scotlands finest..

  <br />

  Here's my unofficial list (you'll probably delete this comment anyways and
  this type of post just deserves to be abused lol )

  <br /><br /><br />

  1. Pat loves driving fast cars, though really the brute power generated by the
  third reich's most infamous love child is really required to drag him around.

  <br /><br /><br />

  2. Give Pat a chance and he'll be a drunk (think Peter Griffen), not the
  American (diet Coke) drunk version  but the hardcore in yer face full fat and
  sugar anglo/scottish version up all night raving ,all rev'd up and ready to
  burst. Pat once drank two bottles of whiskey on a ferry trip to Amsterdam to
  celebrate Trustbase's acquisition by Sun. This quantity of liquer had a mild
  affect on Pat who then found an affection for the wonderful "there's a mouse
  there where on the floor - right there" song, you have to be drunk I suppose.
  Needless to say, Pat's a leader in technology and he's a leader in the pub as
  well, make mind a bitter mate.

  <br /><br /><br />

  3. Pat loves technology, he's a geek, this can be clearly seen by his love of
  sado T-Shirts with emblems such as "No I will not fix your computer" and "Will
  work for bandwidth"... it's a good job your wife loves you mate ;)

  <br /><br /><br />

  4. We all love Pat (somebody has to)

  <br /><br /><br />

  5. Pat loves his family more than anything.
