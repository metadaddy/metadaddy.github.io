  This is a terrific service. I subscribe to Planet RDF, which keeps me current
  with what's happening with the RDF community. Now this, Planet Identity.

  Three people I can think of adding:

  Doc Searls (doc.weblogs.com) (or his IT Garage)

  Marc Cantor (marc.blogs.it)

  Julian Bond (http://www.voidstar.com/index.php)

  You might have them, but I couldn't see from an initial look through.

  Thanks again for this.
