  <p>It seems like OpenSSO allows for developers to authorize users only by
  utilizing the attributes residing in the token that was created after OpenSSO
  has authenticated a user.  Am I correct to assume that OpenSSO doesn't allow
  for a developer to access a different attribute authority after authentication
  has occurred to obtain attributes that way?</p>
