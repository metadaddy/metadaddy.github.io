  This is where Debian/Ubuntu sometimes seems to go too far in its directory
  placement policy.

  I avoid this pain by always downloading the Tomcat binary and putting it
  somewhere in my home directory. Example:

  Also, using Debian/Ubuntu packages for server software can present problems
  when you want multiple instances.
