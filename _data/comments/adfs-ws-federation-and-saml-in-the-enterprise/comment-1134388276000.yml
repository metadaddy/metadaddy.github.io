  One additional thought. There seems to be missing thought as to the size of
  company in which one will want to federate with. For example, if a large
  mortgage bank such as Wells Fargo wanted to establish a federation, would it
  be with other large banks that could afford an expensive SAML infrastructure
  or would they want to federate with lots of small mortgage brokers who maybe
  have three people in the entire office and use what is built into AD out of
  the box?
