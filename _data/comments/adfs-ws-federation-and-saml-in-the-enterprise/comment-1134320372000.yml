  Another trend that seems to not be acknowledged by many identity bloggers is
  that enterprises are also interested in consolidating the number of identity
  stores within their walls and Active Directory makes a great place in which to
  accomplish such a thing.

  Your comment regarding diverse environments also equally applies to my own
  employer (Fortune 100). For example, would it be more honest if the community
  were to leverage existing technologies in some fashion vs SAML everywhere.

  One example may be that you could get IBM RACF to trust Active Directory via
  Kerberos vs making RACF understand SAML.

  I have no thoughts (at least ones I want to share publicly) on what architects
  in other enterprises think about. They are sure welcome to spend more money on
  acquiring products that should otherwise be integrated into existing
  enterprise products.

  Anyway, a balanced perspective is warranted over strictly rallying for SAML.
