  Hi Dmytro/Shedal, if you look at this page
  http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2011/04/calling-the-rest-api-from-javascript-from-anywhere.html
  you can see a way to do this from your own site. Allowing '*' on CORS is
  something we have to look carefully at - there may be security ramifications
  in opening it up that wide.


  As I said on the Force.com blog, we're looking at this for a future release.
