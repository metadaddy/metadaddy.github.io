  Hi Giuseppe! It sounds like you've created a custom object called 'Facebook
  Favorite', or something similar, but you're not referring to it correctly in
  your code. 


  Go to the object detail page for your custom object (Setup | App Setup |
  Create | Objects | {Your object name}) and check the API Name.
