  Hi Pat, we are a new SalesForce company migrating from MSCRM.  I found,
  "Single Sign-On with Force.com and Microsoft Active Directory Federation
  Services" that you co-authored with Rhys Goodwin and had a question.  The
  article states, "You need a Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise or
  Datacenter edition."  Will the ADFS integration with SF not work on a 2012R2
  Standard server?  What are the differences if we do deploy with a 2012R2Std? 
  I appreciate your work you do, and making it publicly available to us lowly
  peons!
