  Hey, this blog looks pretty questionable, but I linked to it from
  http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2010/10/how-to-use-the-new-salesforce-rest-api-from-php.html


  I have your salesforce took kit and I see that it works with php 5.2 +. What
  options with salesforce API do I have with PHP Version 5.1.6


  Are there any other API options for php.


  Thanks in advance.


  Jake
