  Hi Pat, sorry for writing right here, but I didn't find a better communication
  way.

  On this page
  http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2011/03/calling-the-rest-api-from-javascript-in-visualforce-pages.html
  a proxy for JS API calls is described, with a wrapper lib to use it.

  But it doesn't solve my problem, because I don't host my JS app as a
  VisualForce page. Hence, a call to the proxy would still be cross-domain.


  The question is, why not just support CORS and set an HTTP header:

  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

  Then cross-domain API calls from JS would work from any domain, in all modern
  browsers.
