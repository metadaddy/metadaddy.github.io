  Shot in the dark that you're still monitoring this - I've been following your
  article on continuation using js remoting and had the same issue mentioned
  here:
  https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2015/02/apex-continuations-asynchronous-callouts-visualforce-pages.html#comment-2692483035
  - specifically, the static method used to invoke continuation doesn't have a
  controller so I can't use one for Test.invokeContinuationMethod. Do you know
  of a solution to this? 


  Appreciate any help,


  Phil
