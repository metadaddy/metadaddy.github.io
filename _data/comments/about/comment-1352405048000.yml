  I'm working on my first facebook app, and I'm following your example here: 

  http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Getting_Started_with_the_Force.com_Toolkit_for_Facebook,_Version_3.0


  to get some ideas and also to have my "first time" with FB environment and
  facebook toolkit 3 and fb apps in general.


  Using your code I'm receiving this kind of error:


  "sObject type 'Facebook_Favorite__c' is not supported. If you are attempting
  to use a custom object, be sure to append the '__c' after the entity name"


  and i cannot find any solution. Also with the second part of the code there is
  something that the platform doesn't like.


  Can u please help me ? 


  Thanks a lot and I'm sorry to bother you!


  Kind regards, Giuseppe C.
