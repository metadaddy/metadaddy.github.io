  I just worked through your "Getting Started with the Force.com REST API"
  tutorial using JAVA
  (https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Getting_Started_with_the_Force.com_REST_API#)
  and wanted to suggest some updates to the page. There are some errata in this
  page. The link to the JSON Java libraries is broken, but could be updated to
  https://code.google.com/p/org-json-java/downloads/list. Also, in the file
  DemoREST.java, the getString() function on lines 61 and 161 cause errors since
  they are run on non-strings; the function should be changed to optString().
  Also, for people (like me) who want to learn REST but don't have a Java
  development environment setup, it would be very helpful if the article linked
  to a complete tutorial about how to setup that development environment in the
  "Setting up for the Sample Application" section. A very straightforward
  tutorial is here:
  http://www.coreservlets.com/Apache-Tomcat-Tutorial/tomcat-7-with-eclipse.html.
  For novices it might also help if in the setup steps it said that the JSON and
  Apache libraries need to be "imported into" the project (instead of "added
  to") and that the REST API sample code needs to be put in the project in with
  the project source files. Thanks!
