  <p>Thanks, Edward - I haven't seen this error, but I updated the README with a
  note explaining how to fix it if you do run into it.</p>

  <p>Please drop me an email (my email address is in the 'Contact me' section of
  the sidebar on the right of my blog) - I'd like to know more about what you're
  doing with OpenSSO :-)</p>
