  <p>Congratulations for the phenomenal growth of the OpenSSO community, Pat. 
  Such heartening statistics!</p>

  <p>And kudos to Superpatterns, too.  You've been keeping everyone very well
  informed of the progress of OpenSSO and other identity-related matters through
  this blog, let alone that your humor never fails to crack me up.  Take a
  bow.</p>
