  I think such a panel would be a great idea. I can think of one or two Sun
  customers that would be candidates, but there is a general problem here...

  </p>

  <p>

  To appear in public on such a panel, the customer would divulge which product
  they are using, for good or bad, in effect becoming references for that
  vendor's product.

  </p>

  <p>

  For whatever reason, this seems to cause a lot of customers some heartburn.
  Maybe they are holding referenceability as a bargaining chip to get some
  niggling problem fixed. Maybe there is internal policy against favouring any
  one vendor. Maybe the customer doesn't want to sacrifice competitive position
  by revealing the technology on which they rely.

  </p>

  <p>

  In any case, while we do have some great reference customers (go <a

  rel="nofollow">BIPAC</a> - yay!), and more lined up, it's an ongoing task.
  Perhaps you could lean on your enterprise architect peers at other
  customers???
