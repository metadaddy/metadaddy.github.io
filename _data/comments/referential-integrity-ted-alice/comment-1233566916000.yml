  <p>Hey Pat, might be worth mentioning that the OpenDS ref int plugin isn't
  enabled by *default*. </p>

  <p>By default, the referential integrity plug-in is disabled. When you enable
  the plug-in by using dsconfig, it performs integrity updates on the
  member,uniquemember attributes immediately after a delete, rename, or move
  operation. Whenever you delete, rename, or move a user or group entry in the
  directory, the operation is logged to the referential integrity log file
  install-dir/logs/referint. </p>
