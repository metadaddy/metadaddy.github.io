  :( you could me of a light ...</p>

  <p>then as I said....<br/>

  Hi, anyone could inform me about forecasts on the integration of OpenSSO with
  OpenID. I read the blog <br/>

  <br/>

  and did not understand very well! <br/>

  Is there any more documentation, or someone would have a hint staff to give
  me, or this is a legal thing for me is using now? </p>

  <p>Is there any forecast to be added to the core? </p>

  <p>plus a small question:<br/>

  I am not able to download the CVS must have some privilege to make this?</p>
