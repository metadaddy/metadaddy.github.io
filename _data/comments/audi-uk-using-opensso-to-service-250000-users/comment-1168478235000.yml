  Word from Mr Holroyd:<blockquote>This deployment doesn't do federation, or
  actually integrate with the CMS yet, just simple SSO and profile sharing
  accross a single cluster of applications.  OpenSSO provides part of the
  platform on which some of these things can be built in a later phase of
  work.</blockquote>
