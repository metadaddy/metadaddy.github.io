  Hi Paul,

  <br />

  You're correct, of course. It is the RedirectRequest protocol (specified in
  the Interaction Service Specification) that sends the user to the DoHC. I've
  fixed the text of the blog entry and the preso itself to make this clear.

  <br />

  Thanks for the catch!

  <br />

  Pat
