  <p>Hi Mark,</p>

  <p>I assume you meant to address me (Pat) instead of James :-)</p>

  <p>As it happens, we've just appointed an architect on the OpenSSO team to
  oversee security issues - watch Rajeev's blog - <a
  href="http://blogs.sun.com/rangal/"
  rel="nofollow">http://blogs.sun.com/rangal/</a> - for more on the topic. </p>

  <p>While OWASP has some relevance to OpenSSO's security (as OpenSSO is itself
  a Web application), and OpenSSO can help make apps more secure in enforcing
  access management policy, as far as I can see, the main lesson from OWASP is
  that you CAN'T sprinkle on magic security dust - you still have to secure your
  Web app.</p>
