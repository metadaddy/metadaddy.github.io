  <p>With ibc their is a identity which could be anything from a email to a
  fingerprint and a shared secret (secure random number). The main advantage of
  IBC of PKI is that you don't need a internet connection to check or generate
  the certificate. And you don't need a CA so you don't have a scalability
  problem anymore. You can generate them yourself. But shared secrets aren't
  safe!?! With IBC they are because this number is only used to generate the
  certificate so nobody else who don't know this number can generate the same
  private key. So the secret is never send across the internet. The only hard
  part of IBC is that for every connection a certificate is generated so it is
  very intensive to use IBC on large scale services.</p>
