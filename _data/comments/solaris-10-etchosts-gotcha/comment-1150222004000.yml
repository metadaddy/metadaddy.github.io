  It would be really nice to know is the same behaviour is seen on linux too...
  and if so what the workaround could be...

  I seem to have similar issues with the ldap server in certain instances
  failing to startup due to an error... "Failed to find route to host".. and it
  looks like the reason is pretty close to yours when you saw errors during your
  demo setup of federation.
