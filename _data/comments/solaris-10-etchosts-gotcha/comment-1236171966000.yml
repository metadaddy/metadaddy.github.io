  <p>To make this easier on you when setting up a new system, in the /etc dir,
  you'll find a file called nsswitch.dns already configured correctly to set the
  system up as a DNS client. Simply &quot;cp /etc/nsswitch.dns
  /etc/nsswitch.conf&quot; and Bob's your Uncle!</p>

  <p>Also, you'll find that the hosts file is really in /etc/inet. It's only
  linked into the /etc dir for BSD compatibility reasons.</p>

  <p>Cheers,<br/>
