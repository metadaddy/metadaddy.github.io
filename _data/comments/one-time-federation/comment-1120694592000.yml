  Hi Pat, I'm not quite sure that the Entrust folks know about that doc on their
  site! I created it to be part of the ID-WSF Implementation Guidelines, not
  sure how/why it got to Entrust's public site. :-)

  I'll notify the appropriate people and send you the link to the WSF IG if
  Entrust takes it down.

  I also wanted to add to your answer to the original question. If the SP
  doesn't want the user to have an account, then this sort of 'one time
  federation' (although 'federation' has such persistent connotations) is, as
  you point out, the answer. If, on the other hand, it just so happens that the
  user doesn't yet have an account at the SP, but is willing to establish one,
  then normal 'persistent' federation can still work, the user just creates an
  account during the federation process.
