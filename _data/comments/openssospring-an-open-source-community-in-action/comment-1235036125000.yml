  <p>Hi, <br/>

  I'm very keen on using OpenSSO with Acegui / Spring Security (have
  applications secured with both versions). I followed the link to: <a
  href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/extensions/#authnproviders"
  rel="nofollow">https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/extensions/#authnproviders</a></p>

  <p>However some things seems to be missing, I could get the source code (not
  via cvs, always timeout when connecting to the server), but not some files
  like:<br/>

  AMConfig.properties<br/>

  applicationContext-acegi-security.xml<br/>

  pom.xml</p>

  <p>Is there a way to get those files?<br/>

  Cheers,</p>

  <p>Javier</p>
