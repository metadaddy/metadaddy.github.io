  This is something that all building, deploying and running services on the
  Internet should have drilled into their heads.  To me, a system that is
  properly secured has no need for a packet filtering firewall.  My definition
  of 'properly secured' is that all the applications implement the access
  controls required by the security policy to allow or deny access.

  I've got machines on the Internet, and the packet filtering firewalls on these
  machines do very little for me.  I know full well exactly what services are
  running, and that most of those services implement access controls in a way I
  find satisfactory.  Those that I can't turn off, or don't have any way to
  configure access controls, I have to put a packet filter in front of them.

  I see that I have to use a packet filtering firewall in front of some services
  as a defect in those services.

  Anyway - just some ranting from me on security.
