  I have to disagree, Alan. I would contend that <i>even</i> a system that is
  properly secured needs a packet filtering firewall. Here's why: defence in
  depth. We're all human. These are complex systems we're protecting. There is
  always a risk that some system somewhere is incorrectly secured. By
  implementing layers of security we mitigate that risk. Packet filtering is not
  enough, but I would also say that access controls alone are not enough.
