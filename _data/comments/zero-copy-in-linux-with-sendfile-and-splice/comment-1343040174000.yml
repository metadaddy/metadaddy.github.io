  I just can't figure out how to read on server-side in a TCP scenario.


  What I'm trying to do is just like this...


  On client-side I have a file descriptor (my source), then I do a write on my
  socket descriptor: it works fine, at least I hope.


  On server-side, I'm not able to get any byte from my client. Surely, the main
  issue is related to the file size on server-side.


  Any suggestions ? This is driving me insane.
