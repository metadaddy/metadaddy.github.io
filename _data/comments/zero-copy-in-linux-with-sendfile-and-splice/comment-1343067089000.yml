  Hi Ron - you may be encountering the same issue that I did - if you read
  carefully to the end of the blog post, you'll see that I saw the first
  splice() call hang when I asked for all of the data on the socket. The
  solution is to modify the first splice call to limit the amount of data you
  read. I forked and modified your server-side gist:
