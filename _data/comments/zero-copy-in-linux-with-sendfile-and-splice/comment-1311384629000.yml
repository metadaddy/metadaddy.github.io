  I had a similar experience. Performance of spilce() is much worse than
  buffered read/write if the splice size is small. After utilizing it with the
  pipe size (64K), it is better than read/write. However, it is still far away
  from my expected zero-copy. LRO seems to be supported by some 10G NICs because
  of patent issues. I only need OS-based zero-copy on basic Gb/100Mb hardware.
  (I am using it with a embedded Linux.)
