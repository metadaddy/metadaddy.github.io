  As far as I know, you can post as much as you like in a gist. If I were you,
  though, I'd add some more printf calls to see what is happening - how much
  it's reading in each call to splice, what the offset is, that sort of thing. I
  don't actually have a Linux box handy to run anything on right now :-/
