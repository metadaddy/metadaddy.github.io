  It's the same with O_TRUNC !


  In my opinion the main issue is on the server, I guess. When I'm going to
  create the output file, the file size (in byte) is unknown. The client should
  send "count" informations before the server starts write on the output file.


  I'm too tired at the moment and I need to sleep.


  BTW, here you'll find the client: https://gist.github.com/3166618


  You can try to run it on your linux-box and see if you get such monster file.


  Sorry.
