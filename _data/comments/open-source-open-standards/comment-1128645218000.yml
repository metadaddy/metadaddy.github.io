  <p>SAML has one BIG problem: the RSA patent - see the FAQ on
  http://www.opensaml.org/ .  If this was a 'normal' IETF spec, I could look at
  the spec, implement it in our product, and we can all get on with our lives.
  The RSA license, while quite reasonable as these things go, requires me to get
  the agreement of an officer of my own company (who'll probably want to wait
  for legal &amp; a board meeting) and an officer of at least one other company
  (since its an integration technology...and they'll want to wait for legal
  too...). Because it can't be thrashed out at a technical level, projects
  wanting to use SAML face a month or so of delay before the paperwork is
  done... and so something else wins.

  And I say this from bitter experience - the only time I've gotten SAML into a
  real deployment was when it was nothing to do with us: we just provided some
  integration with a third party who had licensed (and could sublicense) SAML
  patents for the whole project. Every other time the patent has led us to look
  at doing something else.

  If RSA's license was like Sun's recently-infamous declaration wrt OpenDocument
  IP ("no paperwork") I reckon SAML would be ubiquitous by now.
