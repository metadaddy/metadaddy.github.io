message: "First off I want to say wonderful blog! I had a quick question that I'd like to ask if you \r\ndon't mind. I was curious to know how you center yourself and clear your mind prior \r\nto writing. I've had trouble clearing my thoughts in getting my thoughts out there.\r\nI do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 \r\nto 15 minutes are wasted simply just trying to figure out how to \r\nbegin. Any recommendations or hints? Thanks!"
