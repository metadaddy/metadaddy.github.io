  Feature-wise, Gizmo is light years ahead of Skype.  But in my experience, SIP
  is its bane.

  Folks who have good upstream bandwidth probably won't notice but people with
  marginal upstream bandwidth get bad call quality.  And while they do various
  hacks to traverse NATs, it sadly isn't able to get across some of them (like
  where I work right now).

  <p>

  They would do much better to support IAX, the Asterisk native protocol.  It's
  a binary protocol, so it's much more efficient.  And it is automatically
  NAT-transparant.  IAX gets past even the super-tight security at some places
  where I currently frequent.
