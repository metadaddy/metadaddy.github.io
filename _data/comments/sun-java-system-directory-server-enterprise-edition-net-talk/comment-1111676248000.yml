  Unfortunatelly, I don't have bandwidth to see the Webcast, if only sun would
  put them available for Download, ...

  About Don Bowen, if you know him, please convince him to start bloging, There
  are not enouth people talking about JES inside Sun's weblogs and, you need to
  do a much better job reaching to people (both in and out of Sun). The talk
  about Directory Services is important but, so is the talk about Directory
  Server (you *only* have the best LDAP server, don't be quiet about it). <br />

  If this guy has something to say in DS development, he has my congratulations,
  I'm using it since version 2 and, the improvement has been obvious. Now, he
  (and you, and me, and, ...) have to reach more people and not be afraid to
  laugh every time someone mentions the advantages of A.D., OpenLDAP, M-Vault,
  Openwave LDAP, eDirectory or whatever.
