  The thing is, nobody actually knows what DSML is, yes, yes, I've read the
  concepts but, do developers really think about such things? What can I do with
  it? How does it compare with products like Tamino? What are it's main
  advantages? <br />

  Vendors added DSML to it's LDAP offer but no one really took the time to
  develop the concept and presented in a clear way. It's left to the developers
  to go and find out why they should be using it (and, let's face it, most of
  them just don't have the time to research everything).
