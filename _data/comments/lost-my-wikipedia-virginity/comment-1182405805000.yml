  Nice little article for a beginner: that's actually a very good size, not
  bloated like so many. It was also nice that you uploaded a picture to go with
  it.

  You'll notice that someone has already done some tidying up, but not a huge
  amount: obviously you got it very nearly right on the first try ;-)

  If you could do this for more products that would be great.
