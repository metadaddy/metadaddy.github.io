  Pat, I'm trying to build a simple char device driver based on LDD3 book. 

  But I got a problem in compiling.

  When I call "make", it produce nothing.

  I have Ubuntu 9.10 (Lucid Lynx) kernel 2.6.32(standard fresh installed).

  Could you give some advices what should I prepare(maybe kernel tree or linux
  header, etc) first?


  Thanks.
