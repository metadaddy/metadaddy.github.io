  I implement my first block device driver for one PCIe card that has utilizing
  the DMA of this card based on this example from
  http://opensourceforu.efytimes.com/2012/02/device-drivers-disk-on-ram-block-drivers/.
  I just replace the memcpy() function in ramdevice_write() and ramdevice_read()
  with my own DMA version of write()/read() function. My own own DMA version of
  write()/read() function work well for millions of times. They worked in
  interrupt mode. Linux crashes after several 'dd' commoands for 128KB data. 
  rb_transfer() is similar to sbd_transfer(). Before I try this example, may I
  ask some questions? Is there any special requirement for the function
  sbd_transfer()? 


  a) Can the sbd_transfer() function call spin_lock()?

  b) Can the sbd_transfer() function call wait_event_interruptible_timeout ()?

  c) Can the sbd_transfer() function call vmalloc()/vfree(), kmalloc()/kfree()?

  d) Is it OK when one interrupt is generated during the execution time of the
  sbd_transfer() function?

  e) Is it OK to call schedule_work() in ISR of the DMA during the execution
  time of the sbd_transfer() function?

  f) Is it OK to sleep during the execution time of the sbd_transfer() function?

  g) Sometimes irqs_disabled() returns true. Does it mean that no interrupt will
  be generated?

  h) Is any one example that can handle the request and end the request in
  different function call?
