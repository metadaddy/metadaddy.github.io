  Hi Pat,


  I did use fdisk to format and partititon /dev/sbd0 however it complained
  about:

  fdisk /dev/sbd0

  You must set cylinders.

  You can do this from the extra functions menu.


  Command (m for help):


  So I went into Extra menu to set the cylinders to 1.


  Am I doing it right?


  Thanks,


  Yan
