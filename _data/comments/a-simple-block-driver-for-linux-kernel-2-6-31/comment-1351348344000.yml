  I'm using 2.6.24. I built built this by using the source from
  http://lwn.net/Articles/58720/. All went well except that fdisk must have
  changed because I have to use x instead of n to create a new partition (typing
  n just says to use x). But in the x menu there is no way to create a new
  partition. Then I checked "man fdisk" but that also does not say how to create
  the partition.


  Can someone give me additional information on how to create the necessary
  partition with fdisk from Linux 2.6.24?
