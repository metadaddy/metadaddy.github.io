  It appears that "blk_fs_request" has been removed in the 2.6.36 kernel,
  causing sbd.c to not compile as written.


  Replacing the line:


  if (!blk_fs_request(req)) {


  ...with


  if (req == NULL || (req-&gt;cmd_type != REQ_TYPE_FS)) {


  seems to fix this, on the lines of a similar patch I found for the cloop
  driver in the Knoppix codebase:
