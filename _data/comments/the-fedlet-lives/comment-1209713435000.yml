  <p>Pat,</p>

  <p>It's always nice to hear from others just how easy it is to do something,
  and I wish I could say that were always the case. Fedlets look great and I
  wanted to try them out for myself.</p>

  <p>Now, I don't have a test environment, and I'm stuck with XP for my testing,
  but I didn't seem to have the same luck. What OS do you use? </p>

  <p>R</p>

  <p>P.S. When was the last time you posted about a good whisky?</p>
