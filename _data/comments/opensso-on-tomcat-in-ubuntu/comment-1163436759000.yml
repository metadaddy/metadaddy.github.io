  Hi Dennis

  </p>

  <p>

  (1) doesn't the OpenSSO web app require many more permissions than merely
  reading the "user.home" property? I seem to remember, the last time I tried
  setting granular permissions for a web app (a while ago, admittedly,
  pre-OpenSSO) I got into a long game of <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole"
  rel="nofollow">'whac-a-mole'</a> trying to find every permission it needed
  before I gave up and granted everything.

  </p>

  <p>

  (2) I thought about that one, then thought "there must be a reason for this,
  it feels wrong to just change directory ownership to tomcat 5 or (worse) make
  it world-writable. The method I described opens the door just enough for it to
  work.
