  I agree Pat,<p>But what makes me wonder  is that Sai, Paul, Arlene to name a
  few who currently &lt;em&gt;"kinda"&lt;/em&gt; power up HP's Identity,
  Security and Portal Server practices are extremely familiar names around
  here... ;-) &lt;em&gt;winks-2-da-nth-power&lt;/em&gt;

  <p>ALSO: HP seems to be investing  a lot in building portal server and
  identity server products, but however they are engaging external mediocre
  skillsets from low cost consulting firms to develop these products.. 
  &lt;em&gt;Makes me wonder why ?&lt;/em&gt;
