  Ahh, it seems Vidhya has been around this block before as I haven't been alone
  to experience this issue.

  http://www.nabble.com/Re:-secure-web-service-is-not-supported-t2390532.html

  Okay as per your directions, I added

  @WebServiceRef(wsd="http://localhost:80080/MagicEightBall/MagicEightBallService?wsdl")

  soa.example.client.MagicEightBallService service;

  to my servlet class, then later on in the appropriate servlet method

  soa.example.client.MagicEightBall port = service.getMagicEightBallPort();

  This builds and deploys but won't run, even if you choose to edit the services
  attributes to disable message level security under the WSP security
  configuration and then redeploy.

  You get security related exceptions as soon as the client tries to connect to
  the service.  It appears that you need to strip out all the security related
  xml additions to the sun-web.xml file, and remove the amconfig.xml file, then
  redeploy inorder to get the service and client to work again minus message
  level security.

  Now, that I verified my service and client work, I attempt to re-enable
  message level security on the service... That goes off without a hitch, but I
  still can't get nb to allow me to edit the security via the web service
  attributes panel of the client's web service reference.  It still return
  "unsupported project."

  Is the Q-build of the enterprise bundle available, because I don't see it at

  http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/dev.php

  Your forum post mentioned it back in October...
