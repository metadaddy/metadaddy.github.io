  Seems like you are creating a Java EE 5 webservice using NB, correct? In the
  case of Java EE 5 based service, after creating the web service client node
  you have to also "use the client" node in one of your sevlets/jsp etc.. which
  will generate a @WebServiceRef annotation which signals the tool that it can
  enable security. The key is to have the annotation on the client which invokes
  this service.

  If you used the bundled stock sample from the IDE (or use the zip file that
  Pat has included) you would be able to invoke the client wizard without this
  additional step because the samples are j2ee 1.4 based and hence the workflow
  for client creation is different.

  HTH,
