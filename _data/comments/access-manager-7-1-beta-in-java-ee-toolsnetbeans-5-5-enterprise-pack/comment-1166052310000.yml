  Using the tutorial, I thought I would develop a Web Service using netbeans and
  the j2ee bundle to ... I had no problem editing the web service attributes to
  set the security settings, but when i created a client with a web service
  reference to this service I could not edit and set the web service setting to
  enable the WSC to send the corresponding security headers to the WSP.  Instead
  I got "Project not supported" in both netbeans on OS X and Linux.  So, I can't
  apparently use netbeans enterprise pack to set the client settings, but must
  edit the sub-web.xml directly?  It appears the reason why the tutorial worked
  is because all the stubs were already there and not generated?  Also, if you
  leverage the "blueprints: Identity_BP1" and start reading into the section
  about "Configuring WebService Client Security Mechanisms Using the Access
  Manager Console" you find the tutorial completely off the rails from how the
  amswer is configured.  So, I don't know what to make of that, because the some
  4 individual Access Manager 7.1 PDF docs don't cover securing web services in
  the manner these tutorials do.  Thoughts?
