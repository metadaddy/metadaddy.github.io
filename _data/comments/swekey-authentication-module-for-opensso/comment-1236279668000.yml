  <p>We are running prototypes of  Swekey auth modules at SSOCircle since one
  month. One module uses user name and swekey the other module uses user name,
  swekey and a pin for additional security. If you have a swekey give it a
  try:<br/>

  Module 1 : <a href="https://idp.ssocircle.com/sso/UI/Login?module=swekey"
  rel="nofollow">https://idp.ssocircle.com/sso/UI/Login?module=swekey</a><br/>

  Module 2:  <a href="https://idp.ssocircle.com/sso/UI/Login?module=SwekeyPin"
  rel="nofollow">https://idp.ssocircle.com/sso/UI/Login?module=SwekeyPin</a><br/>

  You need to link the swekey first to your account. You can do this at the self
  administration page.<br/>

  A cool feature is the logout feature on detach we are just playing with. Just
  detach the swekey and you are logged out.  </p>
