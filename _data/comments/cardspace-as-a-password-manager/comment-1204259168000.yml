  <p>I don't get it.</p>

  <p>In this scheme, all three of IdP, identity selector, and RP need to speak
  the information card protocols.  If they do that, then why not just use the
  regular information card stuff?</p>

  <p>Is there something missing in the information card protocols whereby these
  password tokens would add value?  If so, what is it?</p>

  <p>This looks to me like it's just adding more code and complexity without
  adding any value.</p>
