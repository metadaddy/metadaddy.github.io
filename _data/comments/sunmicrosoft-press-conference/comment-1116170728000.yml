  Well, loath as I am to rise to the troll's bait, I feel I must respond to
  '202.157.176.102's point about 'sneaking off'.

  <ul>

  <li>

  <b>Our Customers</b>: Holy crap - Microsoft's going to release a federation
  product, and it won't support Liberty ID-FF or SAML 2.0. Will you support
  WS-Federation?

  </li>

  <li>

  <b>Us</b>: A third federation spec? That duplicates the other two?

  </li>

  <li>

  <b>Our Customers</b>: OK - we see your point, but we'll have to make this
  stuff work together somehow.

  </li>

  <li>

  <b>Us</b>: Hmm - well, we just made peace with MS - let's see what we can do.
  Hey, MS - are you ready to join Liberty yet?

  </li>

  <li>

  <b>MS</b>: We have no plans to join Liberty.

  </li>

  <li>

  <b>Us</b>: SAML 2.0?

  </li>

  <li>

  <b>MS</b>: Nope. We're committed to WS-Federation and the WS-* stack.

  </li>

  <li>

  <b>Us</b>: OK. How about a way to make our stuff work together, at least.

  </li>

  <li>

  <b>MS</b>: Let's talk about it.

  </li>

  </ul>

  So we did. And the sensitivity of the Sun/MS relationship (and the nature of
  MS) meant that those talks had to be in secret. The bottom line is that we did
  this for our customers. They don't want to be hurting, trying to tie this
  stuff together themselves. We did what it took to get the job done. And if
  other vendors don't like that, well, I won't lose any sleep over it.
