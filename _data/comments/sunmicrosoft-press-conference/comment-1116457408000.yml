  Do other vendors have to 'register' with Sun/MSFT for the RAND license and

  You would not require a license in advance of actually bringing your product
  to market. So, you can go start work on implementing your product, beaver away
  for several weeks/months/years, and only come to Sun/Microsoft to get your
  (RANDZ - so we can't turn you down or charge money) license when you're about
  to ship - say - when you do a marketing launch, and it's going public anyway.
