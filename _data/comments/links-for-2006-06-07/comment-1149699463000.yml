  Heh - it was actually Shift-Backspace that was resetting X - much easier to
  hit. This is an XGL issue; you need to do <b>xmodmap
  /usr/share/xmodmap/xmodmap.&lt;language&gt;</b> (i.e., for me, using US
  English, <b>xmodmap /usr/share/xmodmap/xmodmap.us</b>) <i>every</i> time you
  start X, not just once when you set things up. I put this in Gnome's session
  startup programs list (System / Preferences / Sessions / Startup Programs) and
  all is well :-)
