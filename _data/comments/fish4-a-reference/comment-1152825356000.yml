  <p>The napkin in question likely came from the Datacentre and Storage
  Symposium in Melbourne back in February.  HP's LTO tape division sponsored the
  refreshments at one of the afternoon breaks.

  <p>Sun is an OEM of some of HP's LTO drives, and HP is an OEM of some of Sun's
  StorageTek libraries.
