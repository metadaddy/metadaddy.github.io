  I'm disappointed that a security thought leader like Radia is not as positive
  on IBE as some others.  Admittedly, I'm quite biased here (I'm CTO of Voltage
  Security, which is more or less "The IBE Company.")

  <p>

  There has been a lot of hype about IBE, but outside of this, it does solve
  some substantial technical issues.  In essence, it boils down to the fact that
  access decisions (like who can open a document, or what the policy is for
  accessing a document) can be made at decrypt time rather than encrypt time. 
  This is sort of abstract, but the advantages are easy to see in the simple
  example of encrypting to a group.  With conventional PKI, this problem is
  pretty hairy, and typically requires publishing group certificates, or having
  some kind of group "exploder" server that translates the group into individual
  identities.  With IBE, none of that it required.  You encrypt to the group,
  and the decision to grant a key is made at decrypt time. <p>

  I'd like to reply to Radia's objections in detail, but to keep this comment
  short, I'll limit myself to a few short remarks.<p>

  On (a), it's worth noting that for almost any enterprise encryption project, a
  central server NEEDS to know how to decrypt all messages.  By SEC regulations,
  no bank can actually run a system where they can't decrypt messages.  In most
  cases, it's now an argument about which system implements message recovery
  most efficiently.<p>

  On (b), there are simple SSL protocols to map users to key servers.  Too
  complex for this reply, but we have working systems with 100k+ users that
  implement this.<p>

  On (c), in a PKI system, the user needs to authenticate to a CA to get a cert
  issued.  That binding is typically much much more expensive than an IBE key
  bind. <p>

  On (d), there is a long standing protocol for handling revocation, that goes
  back to the first IBE paper.  (We include time as part of the identity.) <p>

  On (e), we have protocols that tie in with user binding to handle rollover and
  revocation of the master secret.  (Note that we have to handle revocation and
  rollover of ONE key, as opposed to one key PER USER in a PKI system.) <p>

  Outside of the hype, IBE is really very powerful.  It solves a different set
  of problems than PKI, you might argue, but for enterprise security for email
  and documents, it's a great tool!<p>

  I look forward to continuing this discussion, and feel free to contact me for
  a demo or more in depth discussions<p>
