  Hi Pat,

  I had a slight issue with the new feature.

  We have multiple AD Sites and it picked a server in a remote site vs. a local
  one.


  Before the LDAP lookup, a Site lookup should really be performed, probably
  based on the subnet the server is in and then finding out which LDAP servers
  are in that site.

  In a domain with multiple Sites, you could end up configuring an AD connection
  to a server in a remote site over a potentially slow link vs. your local
  servers.
