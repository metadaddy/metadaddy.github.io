  I tried Ed's suggestion, but, unfortunately, name resolution seemed to be very
  slow. The reason is that vpnc on Ubuntu names its interface vpnlink, rather
  than the traditional tun0. /etc/resolvconf/interface-order contains entries
  for the usual interfaces (ath*, eth*, tun* etc), but does not mention vpnlink.

  Adding vpnlink to /etc/resolvconf/interface-order just after the tun* entry
  seems to fix everything. Hurrah - at last - it all works!
