  I think I solved our problem.  Install resolvconf.

  apt-get install resolv.conf

  I noticed that the /etc/ppp/ip-up.d0dns-up script had a comment that said use
  resolvconf if it is available.  A quick search on resolvconf shows that it
  helps manage the resolv.conf entries.

  Now, the resolv.conf doesn't get rewritten.

  :D *Big smile*
