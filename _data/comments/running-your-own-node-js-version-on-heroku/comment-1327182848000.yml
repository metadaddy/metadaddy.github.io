  You can save a lot of time by just looking if the heroku team already prepared
  your node version:


  http://heroku-buildpack-nodejs.s3.amazonaws.com/manifest.npm

  http://heroku-buildpack-nodejs.s3.amazonaws.com/manifest.nodejs


  will show you the available versions in the official heroku repository. Now
  just clone the heroku buildpack repo, edit bin/compile and change the version
  numbers of node and npm accordingly. Commit and push and use this repo as your
  buildpack.


  I was unable to compile it myself but am still able to use node 0.6.8 with
  this approach.
