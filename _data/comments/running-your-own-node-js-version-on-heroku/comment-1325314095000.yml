  Hi Pat,


  Thanks for the post. I'm running into trouble with the support/package_node
  0.6.1 step in your instructions. I'm using a direct clone of your repo and
  getting what appears to be an error in the 'vulcan build' portion of the
  script. It's error-ing out with the following:
  https://gist.github.com/1543157. 


  Any ideas?


  Thanks.
