  Hi mmstud - the most likely problem is that your Heroku client needs an update
  - what does <code>heroku version</code> tell you? You need version 2.11.0 or
  later. In most cases, <code>gem update heroku</code> will update the Heroku
  gem to the latest version; if that doesn't work, then try <code>heroku
  update</code>.
