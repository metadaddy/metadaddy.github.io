  Hi Paul - Yes, I'll create a new buildpack from time to time, but I don't
  really have the bandwidth to keep up with the Node.js release train - as you
  say, it updates quite fast! The recipe is here for anyone to create their own,
  though.


  As for keeping an app running the newest nodejs version... You don't need to
  create a new cedar. Just set the BUILDPACK_URL config var to a different git
  URL with heroku config:add and redeploy the app. I don't think this is
  something you would want to do automatically, though, since Node can change
  significantly between versions...
