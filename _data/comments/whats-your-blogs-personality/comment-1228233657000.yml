  <p>Ha well, I'd say the ol' typealyzer must assume everyone who writes a
  technically detailed blog is an introvert, because they certainly didn't peg
  me on that particular scale.</p>

  <p>INTP - The Thinkers<br/>

  [INTP]<br/>

  The logical and analytical type. They are especialy attuned to difficult
  creative and intellectual challenges and always look for something more
  complex to dig into. They are great at finding subtle connections between
  things and imagine far-reaching implications.</p>

  <p>They enjoy working with complex things using a lot of concepts and
  imaginative models of reality. Since they are not very good at seeing and
  understanding the needs of other people, they might come across as arrogant,
  impatient and insensitive to people that need some time to understand what
  they are talking about.</p>
