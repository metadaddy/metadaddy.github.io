  <p>Hi! Thank you for useful tips!<br/>

  May I ask one question?<br/>

  I have 1 Sun App Server with two applications that i want to protect with
  opensso and 1 opensso agent. I decide to create 2 subreams in OpenSSO server
  for applications user data. Is there the way to use different login pages for
  my applications?<br/>

  Thank you very much.<br/>

  BR, Maria</p>
