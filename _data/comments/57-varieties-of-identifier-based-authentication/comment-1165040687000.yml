  Excellent question. In the short term: it's up to the relying party (in most
  cases, because it initializes the redirect dance). In the longer term, I
  wouldn't be too surprised if IdP announced different "service levels" for,
  say, different $$$, such as: "dear relying party, we are willing to confirm to
  you that the user used their hardware fob and did a voice print, but that will
  cost you $0.50 per transaction. If you are satisfied with our confirmation
  that the user used username and password, that will be free." Then a business
  case determines what should be used for what purpose.
