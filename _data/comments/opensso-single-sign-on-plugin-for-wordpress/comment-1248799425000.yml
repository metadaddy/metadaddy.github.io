  <p>Damien - yes - I think that is the correct behavior. If we have a username
  from OpenSSO, but there is no corresponding user in the other system we should
  show an error page and stop the redirect madness :-)</p>

  <p>I'm also thinking about how to detect and stop redirect loops in general -
  for instance, if you misconfigure the OpenSSO cookie name or the DNS domains
  don't match. I'm thinking about a cookie holding the time we did the redirect.
  If we try to do another redirect to the OpenSSO login page within (say) 2
  seconds of the last one, we're likely in a redirect loop. I'll try this out in
  the Drupal/WordPress providers and see how it works.</p>

  <p>Dennis - the PHP client SDK was a contribution from the community. IIRC, we
  did the identity services soon after, and no one has really used (or even
  asked about) the PHP SDK since - not even its author. No users + no mail
  traffic + no bug reports =&gt; no development...</p>
