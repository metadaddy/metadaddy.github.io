  Lucky you. Last time I went to car rental, they "upgraded" me to an Opel 1.4
  Diesel. <br />

  What a sissy car, lights everywhere, everything blinked and the car was
  slooooow. <br />

  My only consolation is that 2 monthes from now, I'll be driving my "new" car.
  A (second hand, of course) Mercedes CLK 230 convertible. Now that *IS* fun :)
