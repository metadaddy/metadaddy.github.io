  Hi..

  In step 5, I had to change the config file as vif=[''] to get the xm create to
  work. Then it worked fine till step 12. Upon ifconfig, it showed the IP as
  0.0.0.0. So I tried to set the IP manually, as given in the last section. But
  when I tried to connect using vncviewer it showed the error : vncviewer:
  ConnectToTcpAddr: connect: No route to host

  Unable to connect to VNC server

  So I am stuck at this stage. Please help.
