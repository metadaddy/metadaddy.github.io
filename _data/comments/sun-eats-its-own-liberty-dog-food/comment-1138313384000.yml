  Single sign on means (to me anyway) using
  two different authenticated websites and only
  needing to log in once.
  How is BIPAC (by itself) demonstrating SSO?
  I understand that BIPAC is using the L.A.
  credential interfaces, and that's great.  It's
  nice to see us eating our own dog food.
  But I doesn't really get the consumer anything
  until it really provides real SSO abilities.
