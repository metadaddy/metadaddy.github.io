  I bought a RPi-3 package deal from an ebay seller here in Australia. It came
  with a very thin HDMI cable, described as being light and flexible so as not
  to pull your RPi off the desk!

  I connected the RPi to my Polyview 19" monitor via the supplied HDMI cable and
  an HDMI-DVI-D adapter. No display on the monitor except warnings that the
  input was out of range. Several different warning messages flashed up at odd
  times, some saying that there was 0Hz horizontal scan, others saying there
  were various odd horizontal frequencies.

  I edited the config.txt file many times, trying every combination of settings.
  Sometimes the monitor would display OK after something had been changed, but
  next time I booted the RPi up back would come the old blank screen with the
  "out of range" warnings.

  Eventually I got suspicious of the thin HDMI cable and tried a "normal" thick
  one. Bingo! that got the monitor displaying reliably. I found that the thin
  cable had no continuity between any of the shield pins (2, 5, 8 or 11) or the
  DDC/CEC ground (pin 17) or the connector shells. The standard cable had
  continuity between each of these.

  Apparently the thin cable has been made thin by leaving out all the shields
  and other ground connections, probably resulting in severe crosstalk between
  the signal pairs. No wonder the poor monitor was confused!

  Hope this helps!
