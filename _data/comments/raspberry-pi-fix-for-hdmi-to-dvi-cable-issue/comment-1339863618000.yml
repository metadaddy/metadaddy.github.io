  Actually, I went a bit further on my research and I found the following
  information:

  "Couple of small things to note: DVI can carry both analogue and digital
  video; your HDMI cable will only carry digital. So although most DVI-capable
  monitors support digital, I believe a very few are analogue only, and it may
  be worth checking to be sure. Secondly, HDMI carries both video and audio, but
  DVI is video only. You"ll therefore need to use the separate audio output from
  the RPi board."


  Which would explain why some monitors stay dark, they're not capable of
  running from digital signals.
