  <p>Hi James - BPuhl actually says &quot;I left out some sections which
  weren&rsquo;t relevant, such as contact info, etc&quot; and &quot;I actually
  deleted most of the lines which just said: Details: for easier reading&quot;.
  So, this isn't a distillation of an agreement, this is the agreement, with
  some extraneous boilerplate removed.</p>

  <p>Having said that, I'll pass your comment on to Yvonne Wilson (<a
  href="http://blogs.sun.com/yvonne/),"
  rel="nofollow">http://blogs.sun.com/yvonne/),</a> the Sun IT architect that
  has worked on our federations. Maybe she can post something.</p>
