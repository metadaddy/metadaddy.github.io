  <p>You must realise that the mistake wasn't caused by lack of sleep - it was
  the fact that someone had committed the henious crime of using a spoon to stir
  their coffee and then to stir Pats tea - this was the real cause of the
  moments lost concentration.</p>

  <p>My personal recollection is really the smell of the conference room and the
  pile of empy pizza boxes when the demo 'left the building' </p>

  <p>Finally on the smartcard business, UK Gov has just let slip that there will
  be a wireless transmitter in the personal identity card - I see a whole new
  industry taking off on the back of that one!</p>
