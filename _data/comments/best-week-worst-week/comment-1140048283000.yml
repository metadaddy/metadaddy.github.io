  Aaah, happy days.

  <br /><br />

  Greetings, Mr. Durbs... you're right, smart cards have remained stubbonrly on
  the margins, though I detect two small but significant changes.

  <br /><br />

  First, mobile operators and handset mfrs appear finally to be acknowledging
  that a SIM is a smart card with the card cut away...

  <br /><br />

  Second, implementers are realising that, from a usability point of view, it's
  important to have something much more visible to the user than a set of gold
  chip terminals...
