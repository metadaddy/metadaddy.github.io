  <p>Cool! Followed the instructions in README successfully.</p>

  <p>Only one small glitch. I saw 500 error when running demo test harness at
  first. By looking at glassfish log, I figured that there's an unwanted
  'ssl=off' property in TokenServicePool's 'Additional Properties' tab. Deleting
  this property solved the issue.</p>

  <p>Hope this can help somebody ;)</p>
