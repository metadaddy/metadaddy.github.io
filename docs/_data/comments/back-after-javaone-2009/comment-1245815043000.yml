  <p>Hi Edward - yes - code is all uploaded and documented at <a
  href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/source/browse/*checkout*/opensso/extensions/c1demo2009/README"
  rel="nofollow">https://opensso.dev.java.net/source/browse/*checkout*/opensso/extensions/c1demo2009/README</a>
  - I haven't done a big splash on it (1) because I've been really busy since J1
  and (2) because I'm hoping to make it a bit easier to set up.</p>

  <p>You (and anyone else) are welcome to follow the README in the meantime -
  it's all there.</p>
