  <p>Hi Maria - I think you could do this by customizing the login page. I'm not
  sure if you can have two login JSPs (one per realm), but you can certainly
  customize a single login JSP to do things like look at the realm parameter and
  show different UI accordingly.</p>

  <p>BTW - the best place for questions like this is the OpenSSO users list - to
  subscribe:</p>

  <p>1. Go to <a href="https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/Join"

  java.net account.<br/>

  2. Go to <a
  href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest"
  rel="nofollow">https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest</a>
  and request 'Observer' role on OpenSSO.<br/>

  3. Go to <a
