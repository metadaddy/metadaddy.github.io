  <p>Even more scarily, we did the integrated identity management demo for the
  SunNetwork conference in Beijing in June <b>2004</b>. That was a doozy -
  Access Manager protecting an enterprise portal in which you could create new
  accounts in an HR system which Identity Manager then provisioned into
  Directory Server so that the newly provisioned user could log into the portal
  and then (still with me?) access a partner website via SAML 1.1. I'll have to
  see if we can post an annotated version on the web. That's still a killer demo
  of how the Sun products stack together.</p>
