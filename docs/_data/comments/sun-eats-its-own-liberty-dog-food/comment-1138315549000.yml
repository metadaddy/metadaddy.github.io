  Hi Chris,

  </p>

  <p>

  Here's the deal. You have a session on SunWeb. Clicking on a link to BIPAC
  will use the Liberty ID-FF protocols to single sign-on to BIPAC. As far as
  you, the end user are concerned, clicking the link brings up a web page at
  BIPAC that says something like 'Welcome Sun Employee in 95124' with the
  relevant information for your home zip code. No login at BIPAC required.
