  It is important to note that the site is tailored for Sun employees, with
  information on how these elected officials voted on issues that are important
  to the company.  In other words, this isn't just an external site that
  provides information that anyone can get, it's a site that is specifically for
  Sun employees, created in conjunction with Sun's Public Policy Dept.  I think
  this shows the power of Liberty to enable this kind of functionality that is
  both targeted and privacy preserving. It demonstrates the value of the two
  groups working together using the Liberty technology.
