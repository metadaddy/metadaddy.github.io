  One clarification. There is still a regular batch feed from Sun to BIPAC to
  provision and link accounts in bulk, but this feed no longer contains any
  personally identifiable information (PII), so no usernames, no passwords. It
  enables BIPAC to set up accounts in their system so they don't have to go
  through a new account provisioning step when user EIO37832HJD (i.e. a Sun
  employee identified only by an opaque pseudonym) arrives via single sign-on.

  Bulk federation in this manner is the norm when a federated account has no
  'life' outside the federation - i.e. Sun employees have no independent
  username and password to access BIPAC outside the context of the federation.
