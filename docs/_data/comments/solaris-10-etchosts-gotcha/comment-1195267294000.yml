  <p>Thanks for the post; this was driving me crazy for the better part of a day
  when I started getting weird NFS 'permission denied' errors after editing
  /etc/inet/hosts. And evidently because of name service caching, I didn't
  notice anything was amiss immediately. After a 'cat ipnodes.old hosts &gt;
  ipnodes' and deleting the duplicate lines, everything was hunky-dory. As I
  don't use IPv6, I'm wondering if there would be a downside to symlinking
  ipnodes to hosts? I can't try it now, maybe I will in the future.</p>
