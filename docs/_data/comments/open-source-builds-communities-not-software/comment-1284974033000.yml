  Hi James - that would be because I spent some time going through my blog
  fixing broken links to images and such - Google must have reindexed the page
  as a result.


  Doing OK - 9 days into an 11 day business trip to China. Looking forward to
  flying home soon :-)


  Will catch you on Skype sometime for a proper chat...
