  Pat,


  Thanks for the info. I looked in the details of the threads you shared and
  then ported the patch from one of the threads to enable splice call accepting
  buffer size greater than 16348. I was able to make it operational. But to my
  surprise the performance went down further to ~17000 K bytes/sec :-(


  Do I need to include SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK flag in read from pipe too?


  Here are my read and write calls:


  // Splice the data from in_fd into the pipe
      while (total_bytes_sent &lt; count) {
          if ((bytes_sent = splice(in_fd, NULL, pipefd1, NULL,
                  count - total_bytes_sent,
                  SPLICE_F_MOVE | SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK))  0) {
              if ((bytes = splice(pipefd0, NULL, out_fd, &amp;offset, bytes_in_pipe,
                      SPLICE_F_MOVE)) &lt;= 0) {
                  if (errno == EINTR || errno == EAGAIN) {
                      // Interrupted system call/try again
                      // Just skip to the top of the loop and try again
                      continue;
                  }
                  perror(&quot;splice Write&quot;);
                  return -1;
              }
            bytes_in_pipe -= bytes;
          }

  Any clues on the issue?
