  Hi Mukesh - I think it might just be kernel-version dependent. I definitely
  saw a measurable perf increase (about 8%) of splice with 2.6.31, and Samson
  (comment above yours) also sees a benefit with 64k buffer size, albeit smaller
  than expected. Thanks for posting your experience here - it's all useful info.
