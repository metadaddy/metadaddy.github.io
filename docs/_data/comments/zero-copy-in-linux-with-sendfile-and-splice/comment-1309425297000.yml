  Hello Pat,


  Thanks for your quick response. 


  Without zero copy changes I am getting ~25000 K bytes/sec in put performance.
  After the changes I am getting ~19000 K bytes/sec :-(


  One thing I would like to highlight: I had to use below changes for reading
  the data into the pipe from socket,to make it operational:


  MIN(count - total_bytes_sent, 16384)


  Where as conventional read and write use the buffer size of around 64K bytes.
