  Hi Mukesh - the small buffer size (16k) is the culprit. As I mentioned in the
  blog entry, older versions of the kernel have a bug in the splice
  implementation that causes a hang when the pipe gets full (see
  http://www.kerneltrap.com/mailarchive/git-commits-head/2009/10/2/10408). It
  looks like the fix went into kernel 2.6.32 (see
  http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/v2.6.32/ChangeLog-2.6.32-rc3).
