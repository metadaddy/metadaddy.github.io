  Wow - what did the server side print out for total bytes sent? Is it a sparse
  file? (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file) Is it really using 77.3GB
  of disk?


  I can think of two possible explanations - offset is somehow being corrupted,
  so it's seeking to some crazy offset in the file while it's writing, and so
  creating a sparse file, or the loop is somehow broken and it's running round
  the loop too many times.


  What does the content of the file look like, compared to the input file?
