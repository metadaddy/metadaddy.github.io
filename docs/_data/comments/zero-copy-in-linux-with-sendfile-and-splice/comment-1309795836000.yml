  Wow - I don't understand that at all - why would fixing that bug result in a
  performance degradation? How many "splice Write" messages do you see in the
  kernel log? You should be able to figure out what size of chunk is being
  transferred - it should be more than 16k! Of course, the other thing you could
  do is to comment out that perror call to see if it is adding significant
  overhead.


  I don't think the read should have SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK, but you could try it and
  see. Unfortunately I don't have a system set up to test any of this, so you're
  pretty much on your own.


  BTW - a good tip for posting source is to use https://gist.github.com/ - paste
  your source there and just post the URL here.
