  One thought, Ron - add O_TRUNC to the flags for open - i.e.


  destination_fd = open(filename, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC);


  It may be that you've tested a few times, and the file was corrupted when
  splice() wasn't working properly, and you're just overwriting the output file
  and leaving the junk in place.
