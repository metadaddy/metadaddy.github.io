  Hi Pat,
  I always wanted to do the Ruby extension thingy.
  (I think I have hinted you about this :-))
  I guess Tatsuo-san's fast fingers has beaten me.
  Maybe I should extend from Tatsuo's work huh?
  (an extension of an extension LOL)
  Great stuffs. it is unbelievable that people can get things done overnight!
