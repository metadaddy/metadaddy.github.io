  <p>I think there&rsquo;s probably an unspoken opinion with a lot of different
  software products, programs, etc. that might not be &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo;
  that they can&rsquo;t actually be used in real life with real results.  The
  truth is, solution providers, systems integrators, etc. need OPTIONS in order
  to prepare to best serve all their clients and do business well.  We
  can&rsquo;t prepare for everything, and we need to make sure we have an
  arsenal of tools in order to get the job done.  I hope that as technology
  continues to expand we continue to see interesting and innovative solutions so
  we can all keep up with needs and find really cost-effective and efficient
  solutions.  </p>
