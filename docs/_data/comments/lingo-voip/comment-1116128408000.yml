  Hi JB - I asked Lingo exactly that question in February - this is what they
  said:

  <blockquote>

  Other than the adaptors which we provide, the only third party

  devices we support is the D-Link DVG-1402S/L

  <br />

  If you need further assistance please feel free to call Customer

  Care at 866-Lingo99 (866-546-4699).

  </blockquote>

  You could try sending them an email and see if the situation has changed - the
  prospect of taking a customer from Vonage might pique their interest.
