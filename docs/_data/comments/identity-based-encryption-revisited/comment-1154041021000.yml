  IBE's strength, and weakness, is key escrow.  Either you require key escrow,
  in which case IBE may be a good fit, or you really don't want key escrow, in
  which case IBE is a bad fit.  Within corporations key escrow can be very good;
  between individuals, very bad.

  Radia's second point, (b), was about the IBE equivalent of PKI trust path
  construction/validation.  Both need this, but I've seen this aspect of IBE
  glossed over ("you need only know their e-mail address!", well, yes, but then
  you need to securely find the domain's PKG).

  Radia's third point, (c), is not quite right: Bob and his PKG could be using
  Kerberos V between them, instead of PK; and so (d) (revocation of Bob's
  credentials to authenticate against his PKG) is really orthogonal to IBE.

  Radia's last point, (e), is equally applicable to CA certificate recovation in
  PKI.  In both, PKI and IBE, CA/PKG key revocation is hard and has nothing to
  do with the number of users in that CA/PKG; key rollover is a bit different in
  that in a PKI users need to get new certs for their keys, but this is not all
  that different from IBE users having to change their credentials for
  authenticating to the PKG.

  The crucial matter, really, is key escrow.  Do you want/need it, or not?
