  Yes - escrow is key. The other issue that I think is relevant for the world of
  federation is that we are generally concerned with signing rather than
  encryption. Key escrow isn't really useful here, since you can verify a
  signature 'forever' with the public key and you don't really want the ability
  for any party to generate signatures with an escrowed key.

  Having said that, I did identify one possible use case for IBE in my <a
  href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=identity_based_encryption"
  rel="nofollow">previous post</a>, where an attribute provider could encrypt
  data for consumption by a named, yet otherwise unknown, relying party. Maybe
  I'll bounce this off some of the Liberty gurus...
