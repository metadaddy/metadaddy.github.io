  Pat, excited to hear about the new opportunity. You will be missed! It's
  impossible to quantify all you've done for the SF community over the past 5
  years - you've left a rich legacy, for sure. Hard to know where to start in
  recounting all of your contributions that folks will continue to benefit from
  for years to come. I've probably read "Digging Deeper into OAuth 2.0 on
  Force.com" at least a dozen times :) Thanks for all your help in launching SF
  StackExchange. Oh I'm going to stop, there's too many things you've done to
  try to recount them all. Best wishes!
