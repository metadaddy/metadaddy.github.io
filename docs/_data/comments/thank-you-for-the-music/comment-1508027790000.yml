  Hi Pat,

  Your articles on OAuth and Identity in particular have helped me so much.
  Also, they have given me a keen insight into how technical articles are
  written. It is almost amazing to see how you managed to explain such
  challenging concepts so concisely. I will try to imbibe some of this for sure.
  I am speaking at DF this year about OAuth and obviously most of it will be
  based on what you started for the SFDC community. So I thank you and will
  continue to follow you. Godspeed!
