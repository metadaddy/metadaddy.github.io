  Sven Dowideit's working on re-architecting TWiki's authentication and session
  system to enable better support for external user management - for the
  upcoming TWiki 4.2.0 release in June, we should see OpenID support - at least
  for login, and registration - and later, TWiki will be able to be an OpenID
  providor too..
