  Hi Pat,


  Have you had a chance to look at the ConnectedAppPlugin class for COnnected
  Apps?


  Do you think it could be used to restrict API calls to custom services within
  Salesforce and prevent API calls to the full REST API within the same
  ConnectedApp? Ive been trying to find a way to do this but have been
  unsuccessful so far. 


  Any suggestion you have is appreciated. 


  Thanks!
