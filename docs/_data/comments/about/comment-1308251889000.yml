  Hi Jake - re 'questionable' - yeah, I ought to go update my 'About' page. I'll
  put that on my list for today.


  As for PHP 5.1.6... Unfortunately, the default behavior of PHP's SOAP
  implementation is (in my opinion, but not the PHP folks) broken - see
  http://eirikhoem.wordpress.com/2008/03/13/array-problems-with-soap-and-php-updated/


  A configuration option 'SOAP_SINGLE_ELEMENT_ARRAYS' was introduced in PHP 5.2.
  Since PHP 5.1.x is no longer supported (indeed, the end-of-life for PHP 5.2.x
  was announced last December -
  http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-12-16-1) I think your best option
  is to move to PHP 5.3.


  Sorry I can't give you a better fix!
