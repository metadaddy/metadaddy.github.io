  Hey Pat,


  Really interesting stuff you have been working on. I am working with your
  http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Getting_Started_with_the_Force.com_Toolkit_for_Facebook,_Version_3.0
  and I believe version 3.3. There is a step in 3.2 where you put in a
  EncryptionSettings__c.Key. I haven't been able to find too much documentation
  about what I should put in there or if it is made up or retrieved? Any help
  would be greatly appreciated!


  Thanks,

  Brandon
