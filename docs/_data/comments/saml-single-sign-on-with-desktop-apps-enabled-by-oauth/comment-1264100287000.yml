  Hi Jonathan - I think the key thing here is that you can use Outlook to access
  your mail at Google, whether or not Google has a password for you. It's much
  more flexible.


  Yes, you can use SPNEGO to do SSO across Microsoft web infrastructure, but I
  don't think it scales to thousands of IdP's accessing an SP. To use SPNEGO,
  you would have to 'kerberize' the SP for all the IdP AD domain controllers,
  adding identities in each IdP's AD and copying keytab files. Ugh!
