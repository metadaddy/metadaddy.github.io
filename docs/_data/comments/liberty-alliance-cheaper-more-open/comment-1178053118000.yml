  Ah, ok.  <br />Yes, I see how that might be confusing.  But that is, as you
  say, "suggestive".  That section is the equivalent of a signature block and it
  is not binding (i.e. the implication that the applicant is a corporation is
  not binding on whether or not they are in fact a corporation).  To join as a
  Sponsor (or Associate) at the Individual Contributor fee level, just put your
  name in the first block and ignore the second.  That's all.  <br />It is just
  a bit confusing and would be a good clean-up item in any future substantive
  revision of the agreement, should there be one.  <br /><br />Thank you for
  pointing this out.<br /><br />
