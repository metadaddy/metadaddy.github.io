  Nice soundbite, Mr Bag, but it doesn't make any sense. If you look at
  Liberty's work, there is little, if any, overlap with OpenID (for example,
  Liberty's main technical focus right now is web services - OpenID doesn't go
  there). And Liberty != SUNW - Sun is active in both Liberty and OpenID.
