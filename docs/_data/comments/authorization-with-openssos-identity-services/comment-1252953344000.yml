  <p>I have been able to integrate Liferay and OpenSSO, with respect to
  authentication.  However I have been struggling with the integration aspect
  relating to authorization.  I am not sure if it is even reasonable to assume
  that Liferay can be integrated with an external &quot;authorization&quot; data
  store.  The questions that invariable arise when you talk about integrating a
  portal to an external authorization data store are:</p>

  <p>a. Can you setup communities and pages dynamically for a user, with
  information retrieved from OpenSSO's policies (authorization).  Is this even
  realistic?</p>

  <p>b. Can you selectively show pages and portlets based on policies in OpenSSO
  for that user.</p>

  <p>I would appreciate your thoughts on this topic and if you can share some
  documents on if/how this can be done, that would be even better.</p>
