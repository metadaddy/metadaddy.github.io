  <p>Great job, Pat!</p>

  <p>Just FYI, drupal has shib_auth module which has many features, including
  automatic role assignment based on regular expression matching on attributes,
  and so on. Since Shibboleth SP is pretty much the same as OpenSSO from the
  application perspective, most of its features can easily be adopted.</p>
