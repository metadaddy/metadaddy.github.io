  <p>Ramoonus - I'll be taking a look at Joomla/Wordpress in the near future.
  The tricky bit is figuring out the right extension point that gives me access
  to the OpenSSO cookie and allows me to log the user in on the fly.</p>

  <p>Adam - I'll take a look at shib_auth, thanks for the tip! Of course, now
  that the OpenSSO-related bits are working, anyone with better Drupal/PHP
  skills than me (99.99% of Drupal hackers!) can build on this initial
  version.</p>

  <p>Darren - Glad to be of service! :-)</p>
