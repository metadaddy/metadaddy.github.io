  Hi Michael,

  </p>

  <p>

  Correct. Yesterday <a
  href="http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/announcing_open_federation"
  rel="nofollow">we announced Open Federation</a> - the long awaited open source
  federation layer for OpenSSO. Looking at <a
  href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/about/faqcenter/faqopenfederation.html#standards"
  rel="nofollow">Q2 of the FAQ</a>, it sounds like the functionality you are
  looking for is WS-I BSP. We'll be adding this in the next few months. It
  already exists in AM 7.1, so it's a straightforward task to port it across.
