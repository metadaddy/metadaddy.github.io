  JBoss is not listed as a supported container... I suppose since Tomcat is a
  component there of there is no reason for it not two be supported, right?

  Familiar with DoDâ€™s Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) Foundation aka NCES,
  and the past Horizontal Fusion efforts?

  Would there possibly be any interest in your specific group inside of Sun
  entering into a Cooperative Research and Technology Enhancement (CREATE)
  agreement with Joint Forces Command centered around the OpenSSO efforts you
  describe in the development of SAML-based security for a multi-national SOA? 
  I'm just a scummy DoD contractor.  So, I can't speak for the government, but
  in investigating the landscape I had an expectation for what has come to pass
  -- the virtual open sourcing of Sun's entire stack was a logical line of
  progression.  My thought was to propose a CREATE with specific enphasis on the
  further development of SAML-support in OpenSSO to the powers that be as a
  possible option as we have had talks with Sun in terms of SOA related CREATE 
  related agreements in the most general of terms, just not in the specific
  areas as OpenSSO as I ws not fully involved at the time.

  Also, how well can one leverage Access Manager or the follow on OpenSSO from
  outside of NetBeans, say in Eclipse?  Not to be insulting, but as a software
  engineer myself, I would prefer to allow our team the freedom to float between
  whatever tool suits their own personal needs.  I take it NetBeans is just
  populating deployment descriptors and what not for the web service and
  client-- The reason for my comment elsewhere in your blog.
