  Hi Michael,

  </p>

  <p>

  Well - there's a difference between what is 'supported' and what works,
  perhaps with a bit of tweaking. Traditionally, Access Manager has been
  supported on Sun's App Server and Web Server, plus IBM WebSphere and BEA
  WebLogic, since those have been the containers for which customers are
  demanding support.

  With OpenSSO, I'm not sure we've ever explicitly listed 'supported'
  containers. You can pretty much just drop the WAR file into anything - as <a
  href="http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/opensso_on_tomcat_in_ubuntu"
  rel="nofollow">I've blogged before</a>, Tomcat is pretty widely used, despite
  it never having been a supported platform for Access Manager.

  </p>

  <p>

  Bottom line - give JBoss a try and see what happens. Let us know at <a
  href="mailto:users@opensso.dev.java.net"
  rel="nofollow">users@opensso.dev.java.net</a> whether it works or not.

  </p>

  <p>

  I'll respond by email for the DoD/CREATE stuff. Thanks for taking the time to
  comment.
