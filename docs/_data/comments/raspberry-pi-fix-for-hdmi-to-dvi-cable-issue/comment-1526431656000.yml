  Still seeking a solution.  I bought a pi zero W with a TFT.  After soldering
  on the 40 pin header, the TFT works great, albeit too small to show all of
  some dialogs and screens. Any HDMI - DVI or straight HMDI output I try, on two
  different monitors, just results in the test screen being displayed.  I've
  tried a number of configurations in the config, every option listed for
  troubleshooting HDMI out and nothing works properly.


  Has anyone got a pi zero w working with an external HDMI monitor?


  I've also tried a 1.5 and 2 amp USB power supply... no difference.
