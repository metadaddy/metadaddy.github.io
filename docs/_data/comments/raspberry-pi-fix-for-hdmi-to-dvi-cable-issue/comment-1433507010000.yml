  Hi, i just got my new RP 2 B. I have formated micro SD (SD website), record
  the Ubuntu Snappy software. I put the SD card into slot, connect the mouse,
  connect the DMHI cable to RP2 and second end into TV. Than I connected the
  powder source and wait for connection with TV (screen). TV showed "Connecting"
  but after few seconds returned "no connection" .... please advise!  I can type
  any commands without seeing what is on the screen... I dis more or less
  everything according to RP websites recommendations... Thanks!
