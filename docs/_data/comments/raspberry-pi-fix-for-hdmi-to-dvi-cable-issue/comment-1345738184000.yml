  I sympathise with all those having RPi to monitor connection problems. I
  thought that connecting the RS Comp. supplied HDMI-HDMI cable through an
  HDMI-DVI convertor to the DVI slot on my Dell 1907FP monitor would be easy.
  The monitor displayed nothing except the "digital test card" flashing. I tried
  all solutions including adding a "home made" config file to the SD card with
  all possible combinations of set up. In the end I found a good web site -
  "www.pinout.ru" which shows the HDMI to DVI cable scheme connections in
  tabular form. With a circuit tester I found that the the HDMI pin to DVI pin
  contacts on my set up did not match what they should be. Today I received my
  "World of DataÂ® - 3m HDMI to DVI Cable - Premium Quality / 1080p (Full HD) /
  v1.3 / Video / DVI-D (Dual Link) 24+1 Pins / 24k Gold Plated"

  from Amazon. Doing the circuit test again - all pins were as they should be!
  Raspberry Pi now fully working on my Dell monitor.

  Moral of the story - ensure that you get the right HDMI to DVI cable /
  adaptor!
