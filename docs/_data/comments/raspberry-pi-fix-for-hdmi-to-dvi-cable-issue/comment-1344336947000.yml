  I have the same issue, my monitor only has DVI and DisplayPort, but RaspPi
  won't even boot properly with the monitor connected via HDMI-DVI -adapter. 


  Hard to say whether it's an adapter, RaspPi or incompatibility problem. I know
  that my fairly recent 30" supports digital signal, actually it explicitly
  doesn't support analog at all. But it does require Dual-Link DVI cable, so
  maybe that's the issue. More investigation needed...
