  Hello all, just wanted to share my experience.  First time RP user, recently
  purchase a RP-3.  Attached an HP monitor with DVI and VGA outputs and using a
  HDMI to DVI cable from RP-3 to monitor and was getting nothing on the screen. 
  Tried all the added configurations list here and still nothing.  I happen to
  find another HDMI to DVI cable
  (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014I8UQJY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)
  plugged it in and it worked.  I did go back into my config file and remove all
  the added configurations (back to original) and its still working.  Just
  thought I share.
