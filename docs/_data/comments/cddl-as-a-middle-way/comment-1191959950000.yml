  <p>A fundamental difference between &quot;commercial&quot; and &quot;open
  source&quot; software developers are the underlying philosophy and
  perspectives of the entities involved, which is translated in one of a morass
  of licenses.  </p>

  <p>The latter asks: &quot;how can I make money by providing my potential
  customers with xyz?&quot; while the former usually do not consider their
  ultimate customers at all -- they are scratching an itch.</p>

  <p>The latter want a long line of others to validate their existence by also
  scratching the same itch!&quot;  Validation for the former is making lots of
  money.  </p>

  <p>When the pragmatic perspective of say small businesses comes into play,
  SMB's see the former as money grubbers but at least giving them something that
  works well and speaks to their generalized needs.  While the latter are just a
  bunch of ass scratching, control obsessed zealots.</p>

  <p>Now these zealots want to make money too, but they go about it by trying to
  find very na&iuml;ve persons, like on ebay, and selling them free software as
  part of a web hosting ploy. FREE SOFTWARE FOR SALE! Many of the latter could
  care less about the ultimate user, they are just plain control freaks who must
  maintain a heavy hand and who cater to massively large corporations.  These
  are some reasons why Linux in particular and OPen Source in general has failed
  as a desktop OS  </p>

  <p>The single exception, and that exception represents the healthiest and most
  desirable growth aspect of open source, are the BSD/MIT/Apache folks -- Theo
  Van Raadt's group with OpenBSD, Apache Foundation, the Postgresql community,
  etc. Their perspective goes beyond an itch syndrome and transforms itself into
  creative, purposeful seminal processes that truly advance software for
  people.  If you are an SMB in the know, these licenses are the only ones
  acceptable.</p>
