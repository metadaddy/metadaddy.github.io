  <p>And if you actually need a patent license that sun is holding back with a
  TCK license that they tie very non-FLOSS compatible terms with...then it
  hardly matters what the software license is.  I have to admit that I don't
  much care for the CDDL, it is long and muddy and I hate to read it without a
  lawyer present and I don't really like the company of lawyers that much.  On
  the other hand the new Microsoft licenses are short and clear by
  contrast...Kind of odd really.  (of course...i don't have warm fuzzies about
  the FSF licenses either...mainly because I get bored halfway through the
  manifesto part)</p>
