  Lighthouse (Sun IDM) is really one of the best pieces of code I worked with.
  Nice and clean. And really extensible. Great design of Waveset guys. People
  around here could not believe what we did with workflow and form processing
  code in our IDM project (both in XPRESS and Java) ... that kind of flexibility
  is something that will take years for others to catch up. But, all products in
  the IDM area (all vendors) will need a bit of maturing. Even with such a nice
  product as Sun IDM there are some thing to make a bit better. I could tell
  quite a few long "IDM implementation horror stories" :-)
