  Well, and then there's the "Jericho" train of thought, which holds that the
  firewall is redundant as such, and that security now needs to reside not just
  in application-level mechanisms but resource/object level.

  That might be a sound design objective, but in the

  meantime a firewall still seems to me like a good way of mitigating risk. You
  just have to understand which risks it is mitigating and which it is not.
