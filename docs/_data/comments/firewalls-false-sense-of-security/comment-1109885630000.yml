  I just realised, I have a really good, concrete example of all this. As <a
  href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat/20050205#lingo_voip"
  rel="nofollow">blogged elsewhere</a>, I have a Lingo VOIP box. Now, the
  default configuration is to put this immediately downstream of your cable/dsl
  model. This makes me uncomfortable, as I don't know how vulnerable this piece
  of kit is - I don't want hackers finding it, cracking it and dialling
  Azerbaijan on my $. So, I installed it behind my router/firewall, even though
  that currently gives me problems when my PC consumed all the upstream
  bandwidth (e.g. emailing a large attachment) and I can't be heard over VOIP.
