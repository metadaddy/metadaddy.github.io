  Maybe it would be useful for Sun to provide guidance on the practice of
  community formation when it comes to federated identity. No, Liberty Alliance
  is not what I am referring to. Wall Street and Securities.Hub did it at a
  vertical level, same thing is occuring with mortgage banking and phrama.

  Best practices for community formation at the industry vertical level would be
  great for Sun to include the Q1 2006 revision of their identity reference
  architecture...
