  Ah, now, Paul. "If single malt is good, then double malt must be better".
  Single malt means that it came from a single distillery. A double malt would
  be a blend of malts (technically, a <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatted_malt" rel="nofollow">vatted
  malt</a>) from two distilleries. Allowing the blender some latitude produces a
  different result from sticking to one distillery, but better? Well - I guess
  I'll need to do some intensive research :-)

  One double malt I can heartily recommend is <a

  - maybe it's time for another whisky posting...
