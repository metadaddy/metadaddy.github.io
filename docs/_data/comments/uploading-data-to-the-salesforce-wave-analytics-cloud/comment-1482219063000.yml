  Hi all,

  Wanted to one more thing,

  Is there any way to generate metadata json automatically from csv/DB for to
  load the data in wave analytics ??


  As because, I am facing a dynamic change in the DB(Data Base), and every time
  DB changes, I need to change the metadata json manually, if there is a way I
  can generate that automatically then that will be helpful.
