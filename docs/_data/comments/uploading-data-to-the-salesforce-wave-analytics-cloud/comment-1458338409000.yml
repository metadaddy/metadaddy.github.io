  Hi Pat, there is a Analytics Cloud Data Integration Best Practice guide by ASG
  Salesforce, available  on customer success site which has fully worked out
  examples using both WCS and  REST API approaches to load large data files
  with  compression and data chunking. I concur that the official products
  documents did not make it obvious on how to do this hence my reason for coding
  the examples. Hope you find them useful as well
