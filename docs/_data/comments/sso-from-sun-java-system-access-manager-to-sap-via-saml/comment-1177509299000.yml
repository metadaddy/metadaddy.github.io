  Heh - touch√© :-) SSO = single sign-on, so the article is describing how to use
  the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) protocol to allow users to
  access third-party applications, such as SAP, without having to
  re-authenticate. So, I might just log in once to a corporate portal, and be
  able to access SAP without having to log in again.
