  <p>Hi Toby,</p>

  <p>Yes, I certainly can include feeds filtered by tags. If anyone wants to
  give me a tagged URL (e.g. <a
  href="http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/tags/identity"
  rel="nofollow">http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/tags/identity</a> ) and tag their
  posts accordingly I'm happy to make the addition/change.</p>

  <p>The downside is that you have to add that tag to EVERY (forgive the CAPS -
  I would use italics, but HTML is not allowed in comments on blogs.sun.com now)
  post you want to show up on Planet Identity. I don't do that myself, because
  &gt; 80% of my posts are related to identity, so it's a bit redundant. It's
  also good to have a little spice (that's my excuse for the whisky postings -
  <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/tags/whisky"
  rel="nofollow">http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/tags/whisky</a> - showing up on
  Planet Identity :-) ), so I've left the feeds that are MOSTLY about
  identity.</p>

  <p>Shelley uses tags, but has only one post tagged identity ( <a
  href="http://burningbird.net/tag/identity"
  rel="nofollow">http://burningbird.net/tag/identity</a> ). Doc doesn't seem to
  use tags at all, so there doesn't seem to be an easy answer.</p>

  <p>It is tricky finding the balance. Thanks for bringing up the tagging
  option.</p>
