  <p>The conventional tag, such as &quot;identity&quot;, seems like a good
  idea.  At least on paper.</p>

  <p>But would enough people remember to tag their article so that it's
  included?  Or would that result just be to miss a lot of articles that should
  be included? </p>

  <p>Would folks learn and remember what they need to do to get their articles
  included?</p>

  <p>Personally, I agree with you about the content of Doc and Shelly; I also
  have a few more I would add.  However, I don't have any problem skipping over
  their articles if I don't want to read them.  So it's not really much of a
  deal either way to me.</p>
