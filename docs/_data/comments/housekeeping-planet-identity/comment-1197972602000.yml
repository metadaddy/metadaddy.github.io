  <p>Thanks for providing Planet Identity, I enjoy reading most of the articles
  (and yes, I'll subscribe to Doc's and Shelley's feeds, if just for the reason
  that I got so used to them ;))</p>

  <p>I got a question: can you include feeds into Planet Identity which are
  filtered by a certain tag? This way you could keep Doc and Shelley in,
  filtering their feeds by, say, identity or identity management. It would allow
  to keep the focus much better, also for other feeds.</p>
