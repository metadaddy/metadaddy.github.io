  Extremely iInteresting Pat,<p>You'd be surprised to hear that I too "had"
  worked on something similar around 6 years ago. I did something similar for a
  company called "optionwealth" which again is long gone... <p>I had built a web
  application that used a tool called crystal-ball that was a product sold by a
  company called "decisioneering" which is basicaly a MSFT excel plugin. (What I
  had built sounds similar to what you were working on, and thought of sharing
  the info too.. maybe someday we could build somethin similar again.)<p>The
  webapp (ie: a java wrapper around excel) would enable users to forecast (of
  the vested option) how many "options" to hold and how many to "sell" in otdet
  to attain a set target $$$ amount (in 365+1 days) based on historical values
  and also a personal estimate. One also had the ability to get various
  amout/date combinations based on a percentage of confidence of ones own
  estimate vs confidence on the historical values... (I had built a nice java
  slider module for that too...)<p>interetsing aye... how folks work on projects
  that are so similar and have absolutley no idea that others may have worked on
  it too unless the topic of discussion is shared...<p>This "blogdom" surely is
  opening up new innovative communication channels...
