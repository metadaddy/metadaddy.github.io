  Very cool.  There's not many articles out there about using heroku and node. 
  I found this helpful. 


  I'm trying to understand the pinging.  So once a client pings the server, the
  server in turn pings all other clients.  This is so that all the ping timers
  are in sync? Why do they have to be in sync?  


  Also, I wanted to get your thoughts about the timeout.  It seems like because
  of this ping workaround, it's not truly longpolling.  It seems like a place in
  between a timer based ajax poll and true longpolling.


  Finally, you should update the line 


  'echo "{ \"name\": \"node-chat\", \"version\": \"0.0.1\" }" &gt;
  package.json' 


  to include the pg package and mention somewhere in the article to make sure to
  have the shared_database addon.  


  Thanks again for this.
