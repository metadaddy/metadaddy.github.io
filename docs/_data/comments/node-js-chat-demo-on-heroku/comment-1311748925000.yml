  Hi Jeffrey - the pinging is just to stop Heroku from closing the HTTP
  connection on a timeout - see
  http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-routing#timeouts. I've seen this
  elsewhere with long-polling - in the Bayeux protocol, the server can
  periodically send an empty response, which causes the client to close the HTTP
  connection and send a new request.


  You're absolutely right about the pg package in package.json. I'll go fix that
  right now, and mention the shared_database addon.


  Thanks for taking the time to comment!
