  Being one of the author of the specs I can say one of the problem with this
  article is that it does not sufficiently separates the protocol itself
  (WSSOMEX) from the profile.<br /> I would tend to agree that a profile that
  mandates both protocol suites does not do a supremely efficient job but would
  argue that to start interoperating ones need to understand each other (i.e.
  finding a common language): this is exactly what the WSSOMEX protocol
  proposes.
