  <p> I'm not saying that Other Operating Systems would be any friendlier (they
  would most likely just put a prettier face on the message "Your Disk Is
  Fried")... but Linux still has a way to go before that kind of disk recovery
  is usable by a techno-muppet such as I.

  <br />

  <br /> That said, I feel reasonably smug, because I did manage to fix my most
  recent Linux boot problem. Somehow the display/graphics adapter settings had
  got corrupted, preventing the graphical desktop from loading. I was still able
  to log in at a command prompt, and ultimately launch the system configuration
  tools (YAST, SAX) to re-set things to a valid config.

  </p>

  <p>Another powerful argument (if one were needed) for <i>loose</i> coupling
  between the OS and the UI/desktop.
