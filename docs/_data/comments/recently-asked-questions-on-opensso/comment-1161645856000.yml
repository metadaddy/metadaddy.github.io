  hi Nipun

  We can help if you can tell us the single sign on solution(s) that you are
  looking for?

  As you may know that OpenSSO is actually Java Enterprise System Access Manager
  7.1, we are open sourcing all the major features. Docs for Access Manager 7.0
  is at http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/coll/AccessManager_05q1 (We have yet to
  release the docs for release 7.1)

  At the docs site, there are alot of information ranging from different type of
  authentication methods, session failover, policy management, evaluation and
  enforcement, etc.

  Again, it will be great if you can send an email to 
  users@opensso.dev.java.net with your requirements and our engineers can help
  you along.

  thanks
