  My favorite accidental release came from an Apple programmer who was working
  on printer definition files to allow HP printers to work with Apple's laser
  printer driver. When he checked in his code, he forgot to remove the part that
  caused the driver to prominently display the phrase "Icky Poo" in the print
  dialog, anytime an HP printer was being used. I know the programmer, and he
  truly thought that HP printers were disgusting crap! Thanx to a shortcutted QA
  cycle, the driver was released and his feelings were conveyed to HP, and quite
  a few customers, loud and clear. Why piss off just one developer, when you can
  go ahead and offend an entire company and their customer base too?!!
