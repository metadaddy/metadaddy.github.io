  hi Pat,

  <p>

  I have opensso.war up and running without these problems on tomcat 5.5 on
  Solaris 10. I have tomcat user as root. :-)

  <p>

  For non-root, setup these before deploying the opensso.war

  <ol>

  <li>set

  <pre>permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read";</pre>

  <li>make sure that the tomcat admin user has read and write permission to his
  home directory.

  </ol>

  thanks
