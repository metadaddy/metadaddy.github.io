  <p>Hi Dave - well, at the time I was pouring, I hadn't done the eBay search
  :-) Having said that, I paid way less than $530 for it (I honestly don't
  believe it's worth that, even today) and I don't think my remaining 1/3 of a
  bottle is very marketable. </p>

  <p>Besides - whisky always seems to taste better when you share it with
  someone else who appreciates it :-D</p>
