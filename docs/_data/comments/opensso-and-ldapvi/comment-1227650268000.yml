  <p>Hi Peter - any LDAP v3 client should be ok. I just tried the LDAP Browser
  from the link you provided and it works fine. Be sure to configure the
  connection correctly - default port for the embedded OpenDS is 50389, username
  is 'cn=Directory Manager' (without the quotes), same password as you specified
  for amadmin.</p>
