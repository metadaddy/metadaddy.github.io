  Hi Pat,
  I have some questions regarding OpenSSO.
  Can i keep apache in front of JBoss using mod_jk and
  use apache WEB agent (no j2ee agent) to intercept requests?
  What about SSL (termination?)
  Can you just tell how it can be done?
  I have installed web agent 2.2 (for apache 2.0.54)on windows 2003
  i dont know how to configure it for apache 2.0.59
  Is there any resource available?
  I'm stuck on this issues for past two weeks!
