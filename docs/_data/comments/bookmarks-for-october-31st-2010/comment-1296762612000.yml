  Hi,

  I loved your Java client access to the REST API. I am unable to get it to work
  with Tomcat7 and eclipse-helios. It keeps failing when i click on the link for
  /oauth. Could you possible send me your war file or eclipse project file for
  the war sample so I can play around with it ? I have added a bunch of jars
  reqd but still doesn't work.

  Just trying to make it work with java.

  TIA,

  Vijay
