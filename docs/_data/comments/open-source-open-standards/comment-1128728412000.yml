  Thanks for the comment, Brian. Unfortunately, SAML is by no means unique in
  this respect - other standards also include the offer of a license. RSA are
  actually being pretty good in disclosing the license and making it almost
  trivial to obtain. Have a look at the <a
  href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/wss/ipr.php" rel="nofollow">IPR
  page for WS-Security</a>. And IETF specs are not immune - as <a
  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3979.txt" rel="nofollow">RFC 3979</a>
  explains.

  Having said that, of course, you are correct - this is a hurdle (albeit pretty
  low) to SAML implementation. Maybe Sun's recent non-assert covenants will show
  the way for other vendors...?
