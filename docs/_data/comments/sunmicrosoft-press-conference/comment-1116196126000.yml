  I'm sorry Pat, I know this is your weblog but, please alow me to answer this
  last comment. <br />

  I can't understand why "this kind of attitude angers people". Are those people
  anger because RedHat now owns Netscape Directory Server? Last time I checked,
  Nscp Dir. Server didn't follow the Ldap standard in dealing with Multi Master
  Replication. <br />

  Should RedHat leave Nscp customers out in a support limbo or should they
  continue to sell and improve the product while they try to integrate it in
  they're business model (making it OSS, I presume)?<br />
