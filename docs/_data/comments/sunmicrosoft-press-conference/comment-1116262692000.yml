  <p>Hello Pat, </p>

  <p>Thanks for sending out the pointers to these.  I note the Web Single
  Sign-On Metadata Exchange Protocol document states:</p>

  <blockquote>"The authors hope to solicit your contributions and suggestions in
  the near future."</blockquote>

  <p>At present, the authors do not appear to have a means to receive solicited
  comments, as I haven't been able to find a discussion board, mailing list,
  developer's area etc. mentioned either in this document, or in the SDN or
  MSDN  developer pages linking to the document.  </p>

  <p>(The other specification, in contrast, does provide contact info for at
  least a subset of its authors.)</p>

  <p>I found what might be a minor mistake (missing word?) in this document, and
  was wondering if

  there was going to be an errata page for this specification, to track reviewer
  and implementation issues?</p>

  <p>Thanks in advance,<br />

  <br />

  Mark Wahl<br />
