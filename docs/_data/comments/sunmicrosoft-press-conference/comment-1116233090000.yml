  Yes, <i>you</i> are no longer at war, <i>your</i> customers need something,
  <i>you</i> got your $2bn, screw the rest of the industry.  Just listen to
  yourself and face the facts: Sun is no open systems leader anymore, it's a
  company 1/5th the size of Dell that is primarily concerned with its own
  short-term survival.  Sun's claims to the contrary are merely an unnecessary
  distraction for people who still believe in open systems.  The sooner you drop
  those claims, the sooner everybody can move on.

  What an embarrassing statement for Sun: you think the only two options are two
  collaborate with Microsoft or reverse engineer them.  In any case, I work for
  a small consulting firm; we aren't even publicly traded.  Maybe you should be
  more concerned about the stock of the company you work for.
