  Let's be realistic here. We come to a settlement with MS. Our customers give
  us requirements that they expect to see fulfilled, now that we are no longer
  at war. Do we:

  <ul>

  <li>

  <b>A</b> - Work with Microsoft, in private if necessary, to define a mechanism
  for interoperability, publishing it as soon as its done and submitting it to a
  standards body at the earliest opportunity.

  </li><li>

  <b>B</b> - Reverse engineer some quasi-solution, needing more engineers, more
  time and resulting in something that kind of works, most of the time, until
  the next service pack from MS.

  </li>

  </ul>

  If you chose B, well, I hope I don't hold stock in the company you work for.

  Finally, to answer the earlier comment that the

  <blockquote>

  fact sheet lists only Sun and Microsoft products as "products that support
  specifications".

  </blockquote>

  Read the fact sheet carefully. It lists Sun and MS products that <i>will</i>
  support the specs. Neither Sun nor MS ship any product today that supports the
  new specs. They are published now, and open for other vendors to implement.
  It's entirely possible that one or more other vendors might beat both Sun and
  MS to market.
