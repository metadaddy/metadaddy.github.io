  I too am dying to figure out the answer to this.  Been searching all over for
  people with the same problem.

  I made a quick hack to /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-script to add a 'return' statement
  at the top of the make_resolv_conf after I start up my vpn.  This seems to
  stop dhcp from updating the resolv.conf.  Of course whenever I get offline and
  need to acquire an IP address from a DHCP server, I need to comment out the
  'return' statement.  Not optimal at all!
