  Hi Neal - (1) No - I don't know of such a beast, but it might be possible to
  create one using the web agent code as a basis. (2) I'm not sure they should.
  If CAS is working for you, then great, leave it alone. If you want integration
  with Java EE declarative and programmatic security, a <a

  of agents for common containers</a>, federation via SAML and Liberty ID-FF
  (coming soon) and even  web services security via WS-I BSP and Liberty ID-WSF
  (again, coming soon), then you may well want to consider OpenSSO. (I'm not an
  expert on CAS, but, as far I can see, it doesn't supply any of these).
