  Hi Masood - I've really not spent enough time looking at <a
  href="http://openid.net/" rel="nofollow">OpenID</a> (it's on my todo list to
  do some more). One nugget for you - the OpenID folks were at <a
  href="http://ios.windley.com/wiki/IOSVan" rel="nofollow">IOS Vancouver</a>,
  where there was good discussion on the differing design points of OpenID vs
  SAML, and a commitment (<a href="http://ios.windley.com/wiki/NoID4Me"
  rel="nofollow">in this session</a>) from both sides to try to meet in the
  middle.
