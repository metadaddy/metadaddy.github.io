  <p>Pat, a redirect within two seconds will not indicate a loop - at least not
  for us. We have the 'problem' where our backend application is behind sjsws
  acting as a URL policy enforcement point.  In CDSSO mode the first access to
  that application is the POST of LARES, this post is proxied back to the app,
  but without the session cookie in the request as that cookie is set on
  response to the LARES.<br/>

  Because the backend app requires the session cookie (it uses j2ee agent -
  though it could be because it uses SDK) it redirects back to login which
  imediately redirects back as the user is authenticated, this time the session
  cookie comes through.<br/>

  I thought there was already an option to stop redirects after a number of
  redirects - will try find that setting...</p>
