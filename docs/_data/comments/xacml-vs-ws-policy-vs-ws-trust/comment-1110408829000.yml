  I think the JCP is as close to an open standards group as you can get while
  still having a single vendor underwrite the effort. <a

  open to all who apply</a>. And look at the <a

  - there are major Sun competitors there - IBM, CA, BEA, Novell - in fact,
  pretty much everyone except MS, and they would be welcome to join.
