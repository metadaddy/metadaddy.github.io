  Yep, sounds familiar.

  Let me tell you 2 stories. There was a time when sun, in Portugal, had zero
  presence (about 15 years ago). Almost 100% of the RFP's we got were from big
  companies (Banks and Government) that already had decided the deal should go
  to this or that seller and, they consulted us (the Sun resellers) because we
  were easly discarded. that way, they could get theyre 3 proposals and issue
  the deal to the "approved" guy (We started groing when Sun's solution was so
  much better than anyone else that, they started giving us a chance). The thing
  still continues but, now we're not easly discarted anymore.

  Also, we (the same Sun resellers) were the first to sell appliances to our
  customers. I think the first was a small hardware FW, ideal for branch offices
  to encript and monitor trafic to the head offices. We almost droped the thing,
  Everyone was expecting us to customise the darn thing but, customisation
  wasn't even possible with that thing (an appliance, see it like a toaster).

  Some deals are lost because the competition makes a better job, other deals
  are lost because they were lost in the first place. Bill Gates, came to a
  meeting in Portugal with the Portuguese President, care to wonder why?
