  Horoscope is just a tongue-in-cheek example of a service that needs some piece
  of personal information and doesn't care who you are as long as you are
  authorized to be there.

  A similar example would be a weather service - they would need your location
  to give you the forecast, but, again, they don't need your actual identity.
