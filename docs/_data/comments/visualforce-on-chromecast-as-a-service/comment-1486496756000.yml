  Will your Heroku app keep the Chromecast screen saver from kicking in? We
  wrote a VF page that lists work orders with their status. It refreshes the
  page block every 2 minutes but, not the entire page. The other day when I
  walked by the Chromcast had started displaying pictures rather than the VF
  page.


  Any thoughts?


  Thanks!
