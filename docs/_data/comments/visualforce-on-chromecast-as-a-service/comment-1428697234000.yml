  Hi Pat! Thanks for making such an awesome tool available. 


  Unfortunately, while trying to use this service recently, we began getting
  errors returned from our chrome device. 


  [browser] [SEVERE] Error: Uncaught Error: Timeout
  (chrome-extension://dlioch.../background_script.js @ Line: 86


  The weird thing is that we have other TVs displaying this same VF page and I
  can connect using this app and change the VF page those are displaying, but if
  the TV is turned off and back on, and the cast essentially stopped, we can no
  longer cast this app to the TV anymore. 


  Did anything change recently on either the sender or receiver? I'm new to the
  chromecast and how it all works. Any help would greatly be appreciated.


  I will mention that casting a tab to any of our chromecast devices still
  works, but of course that doesn't keep the cast alive 24/7 like it is when
  using your app.


  Thanks!


  Jason
