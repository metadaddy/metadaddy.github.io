  Hi Pat! This is a great work.


  As you mention in the end for any new ideas. Just wondering - if you have any
  thoughts on Oculus VR GEAR with Salesforce.


  It could be a 360 degree view or imagination of a particular Salesforce record
  showing enough details what a user could look for. This will be at one view
  gets to see more info( unlike desktop browser) may be. I am lil excited to try
  this(let me know if I can work with you on a github project) and show a quick
  demo of an account with related opps or cases in that multi-dimension if that
  possible. 


  Albeit it's just a thought I like to share here.


  Thanks

  Vasu Rampally
