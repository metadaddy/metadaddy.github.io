  You dont need to manually create a @WebServiceRef annotation. If you have a
  servlet where you want to use this service reference, just drag and drop the
  client reference node into the servlet where you want to invoke he service..
  this would automatically create the annotation for you and then the security
  dialog will be enabled. - Vidhya
