  okay, just saw the drag dropp response... yeah, that works... you have to drag
  the method from the web service reference... and it drops in a bunch of canned
  code to access the method... sweet.

  Yet, "project not supported" still is their under the edit web service
  attributes...  So, i gotta keep  dropping and dragging 'til it pops up cause
  of the bug?
