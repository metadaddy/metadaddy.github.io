  Yes, you're corrrect.  I have created a Java EE 5 webservice using NB, and
  then followed up creating the web service client in another project using NB
  tool features, and created a reference to the the service under "Web Service
  References" folder in NB.  So, I have to apply @WebServiceRef annotation on
  the servlet making use of the Web Service Reference?  I gotta read up more on
  Java EE 5 web service development... As I've written namely j2ee 1.4;
  specifically, axis based services.
