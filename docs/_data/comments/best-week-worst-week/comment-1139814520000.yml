  Ah Mr Pat. Halcyon days indeed! I remember the feeling when we arrived at the
  offiec that morning and there was police tape everywhere. Neither of us wanted
  to believe the box had been stolen but there was the hole in the window, and
  there was the hole on the bench.

  You'd think we might have learnt from the experience but I'll wager that
  you've had more than one or two all-nighters since then...I know I have.

  More interesting that nearly 8 years later, smart cards are no more widely
  used for e.g. boarding passes, digital wallets etc. than they were then. Which
  just goes to show, it's not technical evolution that we need so much as
  political will.

  Plus ca change...
