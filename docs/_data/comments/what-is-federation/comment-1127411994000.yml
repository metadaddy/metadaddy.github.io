  WOW !!<p>Talk about obtaining more knowledge via blogs rather than from
  product docs ;-) <p>

  I have used dynamic user creation and have been able to dynamically provision
  accounts using <a
  href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml"
  rel="nofollow">Access Manager</a>. I also have been able to use <a
  href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml"
  rel="nofollow">Access Manager's</a> post processing class to keep the user
  attributes including &lt;strong&gt;ROLES&lt;/strong&gt; from the remote system
  in synch with the local datastore. But I was not aware that this "Dynamic user
  Creation" feature worked with "Federated Authentication".<p>

  I was also aware of the "bulk" federation, but what i'm not too clear on is if
  'bulk' federation is possible with accounts only on one side ? and not the
  other.

  <p>BTW: When did <a
  href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/federation_mgr/index.xml"
  rel="nofollow">Federation Manager</a> come about ?? I'm falling behind....
  need to catch up...
