  Hey Jaime, DIDW was ok - unfortunately, I was only there Monday and Tuesday
  and I was on booth duty most of the time, but I did get to meet <a
  href="http://www.identityblog.com/" rel="nofollow">Kim Cameron</a>, <a
  href="http://ericnorlin.typepad.com/weblog/" rel="nofollow">Eric Norlin</a>,
  the <a href="http://knowidentity.typepad.com/tnt/" rel="nofollow">Trusted
  Network Technology</a> guys and a whole lot of other folks. I did get to the
  '<a href="http://cis-berkman.editme.com/" rel="nofollow">identity gang</a>'
  meeting on Monday (blogged by Marc Canter <a
  href="http://marc.blogs.it/archives/2005/05/id_gang.html"
  rel="nofollow">here</a> - that was interesting - certainly something we'll be
  keeping an eye on.

  <br />

  The remainder of the week was devoted to rehearsals for the Sun/Microsoft
  event on Friday - which I'm just about to blog...
