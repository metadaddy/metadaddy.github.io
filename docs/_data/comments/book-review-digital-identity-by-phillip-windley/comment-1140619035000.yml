  Hi SuperPat,

  Just a quick one (hope!), would this be "THE" book you'd recommend as "must
  read" for a newcomer to the Identity Management/Federation world? If not,
  which other one would you suggest? (I know this is not a fair question 'coz it
  might be too difficult to answer; however I'd be very sattisfied if you could
  guide me on what's the best reading "as of now" on the subject, since I am
  slowly moving into the eGovernment grounde...).

  Thanks!

  Rafa F.
