  Thanks for the review.  I really enjoyed this read as well.  In fact, I found
  your site via a Google phrase search on "identity maturity model", as I took
  great interest in the Windley breakdown of the model into its constituent
  levels.

  I do enterprise identity work in higher-ed, located at the University of
  Victoria, in Canada.  We are using Sun Identity Manager there in a deployment
  that is ongoing right now....

  Thanks !
