  Hey Pat, thank you very much for this blog. I got one question regarding IP
  whitelisting. Say I have a non-public external webservice, which Salesforce
  can consume as a client. Do I still need  to whitelist the Salesforce IP using
  mutual TSL?  Meaning, is mutual TSL built on top of IP whitelisting?
