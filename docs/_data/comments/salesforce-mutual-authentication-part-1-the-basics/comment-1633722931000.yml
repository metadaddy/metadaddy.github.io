message: "Hi Kumar,\r\nWere you able to resolve your issue.\r\nI am facing the exact same issue - Connect from Salesforce using ADP cert to REST API through Marketplace.\r\n=======\r\nHere are some of the details:\r\nI am trying to implement REST API callout from salesforce. I am given a certificate (xyz.CER file and private key) from REST API application to use for mutual authentication. (I use this cer and key file in Postman to invoke API and it works fine)\r\n\r\nHow do I upload and use this certificate and key in Salesforce?\r\n\r\nHere is what I tried:\r\n\r\n1)\r\nIn setup, I went to \r\n\"Certificate and Key Management\" -&gt; Upload Mutual Authentication Certificate\" \r\n\r\nand uploaded xyz.cer file. I CANNOT upload KEY file. It allows only one file.\r\n\r\nI tried to use 'labelname' in code as below screenshot:\r\n\r\nHttpRequest req = new HttpRequest(); \r\n\r\nreq.setClientCertificateName('labelname');\r\n\r\nI am getting error : \r\n\r\n401 Unauthorized with message : Request did not provide the required two-way TLS certificate\r\n\r\n2)\r\n\r\nI combined cer file and key file as suggested below in PEM file, but this didn't work either.\r\n\r\nSalesforce is not recognizing it as certificate. I didn't have root certificate in this chain. Wondering if that will fix the issue.\r\n\r\n—–BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY—– (Your Private Key) —–END RSA PRIVATE KEY—– —–BEGIN CERTIFICATE—– (Your Primary SSL certificate) —–END CERTIFICATE—–\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,"
