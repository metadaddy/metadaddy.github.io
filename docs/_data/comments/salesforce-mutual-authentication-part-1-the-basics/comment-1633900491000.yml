  Hi Leon - all outbound connections from your Salesforce org must be configured
  in either Remote Site Settings or Named Credentials - see
  https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_callouts_remote_site_settings.htm


  Mutual authentication is independent of those settings - you have to configure
  both.


  IP whitelisting is for inbound connections.
