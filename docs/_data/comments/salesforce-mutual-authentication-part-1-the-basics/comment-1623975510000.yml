  Hi Vlad... Unfortunately, it's not possible; you have to use a 'real' SSL
  server cert signed by a CA trusted by Salesforce:


  <blockquote>When sending outbound messages, delegated authentication requests
  or Apex callouts to secure/SSL endpoints (e.g.
  <code>https://myintegration.acme.com</code>), a Salesforce.com organization
  (acting as the client) will only trust the target host (that will act as the
  server) if this presents a certificate signed by a root Certification
  Authority (CA) [...]. In other words, in this scenario self-signed
  certificates are not allowed to be used by the target host.</blockquote>
