  Very nice video. <br />

  It would help for people who are a little more new to this though if you added
  slides in between the messages showing the routing of the messages. You could
  have a slide of the main actors (the user agent, the web site one is looking
  for authentication from, the authenticator,...) and have a glowing arrow show
  the direction of the message.

  Something like that would help get an overview of what is happening.
