  Dear Pat,thank u 4 that wonderful post.

  Cud you  plz suggest something 4 thhis problem i am facing:

  I am testing a custom inter-process semaphore implementation where semaphore
  is called as a function, ie, one function to create sem,another function to
  take sem and so on.

  I am forking a process and i want the sem to be created in the shared memory.

  I cannot pass the sem_t *sem value to the custom function(it has only one
  argument,which is semaphore name).

  What can i do to make this function run in the shared memory space?Or how can
  i get around this problem?
