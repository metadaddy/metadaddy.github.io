  Michael - that's nonsense. As of this writing, not even a Microsoft employee
  would state that WS-Federation is a standard. Microsoft and other parties have
  <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2007-03-20-a.html"
  rel="nofollow">proposed a technical committee</a> at OASIS to standardize
  WS-Federation. If it was already a standard (and which organization, so far,
  has made it so?) what would be the point?
