  Hi James,

  <br />

  Thanks again for the comments. I would never propose SAML as a 'one size fits
  all' solution - I see its principal utility in cross-domain web single
  sign-on. Some situations may well call for more tightly coupled approaches
  such as RACF-AD via Kerberos (being neither a RACF, AD or Kerberos expert I
  can't comment on that example) but where enterprises (or even divisions of an
  enterprise) have autonomous identity management infrastructure, then SAML
  meets all of the requirements our customers have expressed, including vendor
  independence.

  <br />

  Moving on to your second comment, this is complex stuff in which the merits of
  the technology are a very small factor. We have seen that the contract issues
  of federation require much more time and energy than the technical
  implementation. A model that had a large financial institution such as Wells
  Fargo federating with many small mortgage brokers is technically
  straightforward, but, I believe, breaks when it comes to the legal and
  contract issues. The purpose of the federation would be to allow individual
  brokers to authenticate locally in their own environment, then single sign-on
  to the big FI. Each broker firm would have to satisfy big FI as to the
  security and compliance of their environment. I think, in this kind of model,
  big FI would prefer to keep control of the authentication process and have
  each broker manually log in.

  <br />

  A really good example of what <i>does</i> work is <a
  href="http://www.routeone.com/" rel="nofollow">RouteOne</a>, a web-based
  credit application management system developed by the finance arms of
  DaimlerChrysler, Ford, General Motors, and Toyota. RouteOne use SAML (in fact,
  Sun Java System Access Manager's implementation of SAML) to enable single
  sign-on for auto dealers across the credit application systems of various auto
  manufacturers. Here, the individual user logs into RouteOne and is given
  access across a number of systems. The legal framework is much easier to
  manage since everyone is authenticating to RouteOne and they have relatively
  few relationships with the manufacturers.

  <br />

  At the end of the day, you pick the appropriate tool for the job. For example,
  for desktop-to-web single sign-on we implement SPNEGO, which is effectively
  Kerberos in a browser-friendly HTTP wrapper, since the vast majority of
  desktops are running Windows. ADFS' built-in features may well enable simple
  federations where all parties are using MS technology (I really don't mean
  that to sound patronizing - I just haven't seen any evidence that it will be
  appropriate for large, complex deployments). SAML is a mature, technically
  capable, standardized, interoperable solution supported by the majority of
  identity management vendors and is proven in many deployments, large and
  small.
