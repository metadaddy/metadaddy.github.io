  I have been attempting to setup a panel at an industry conference on the topic
  of federated identity where competitors share the same external users but
  haven't had any luck. So far, the conversation at conferences has been more
  about all the wonderful things that vendors do for their customers instead of
  the wonderful things customers do for themselves. Any assistance in this
  regard is appreciated...
