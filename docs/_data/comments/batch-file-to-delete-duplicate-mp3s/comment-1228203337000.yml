  <p>1. Start/Run/notepad<br/>

  2. Copy everything from @echo off to the third closing parenthesis
  inclusive.<br/>

  3. Paste into notepad.<br/>

  4. Change the f:\my music\ to be wherever your MP3s are.<br/>

  5. File/Save - give it some name like c:\dedupe.bat - the .bat extension is
  important!<br/>

  6. Start/Run/cmd<br/>

  7. Type in 'c:\dedupe.bat' without the quotes</p>

  <p>The script should run. You can actually save it anywhere you like - I just
  used 'c:\' as it's pretty much guaranteed to be there :-) The script reports
  on its progress, and only deletes files that are identical to the originals,
  so it should be pretty safe.</p>

  <p>Any problems - just let me know here in the comments.</p>
