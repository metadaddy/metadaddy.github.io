  Hi Pat,


  Would you still happen to have the resources mentioned in your article as I
  want to setup openam with google apps - but all of the links on the internet
  (of which there are many) seem to die at the Oracle page. The step-by-step
  instructions/videos would be a real help and I don't even mind editing that
  xml file! :-)


  Best Wishes

  Enzio
