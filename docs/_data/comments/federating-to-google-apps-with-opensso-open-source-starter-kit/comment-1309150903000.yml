  Hi Enzio,


  Unfortunately, no, I don't have any of those resources. As far as I remember,
  setup is very straightforward via the wizard in OpenAM. You should be able to
  just click through the wizard and follow the instructions. I setup SSO from
  OpenAM to Salesforce a little while ago and it all pretty much just worked.


  Cheers,


  Pat
