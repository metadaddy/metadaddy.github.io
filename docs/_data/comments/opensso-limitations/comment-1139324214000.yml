  Pat, good and fair reply. Yes, I'm that Marty. I didn't mean to say that the
  Sun technology is toy technology. The underpinnings are very respectable stuff
  that people should take seriously. The toy comment was about the limitation to
  a domain (no matter how flexible). That limitation, in the context of what the
  user actually wants (Single Sign On, one password), is quite restrictive.

  We at Symas did a demonstration of an SSO capability for one of the
  household-name security ISVs several years ago. Long story. Best told over
  adult beverages. We put it up as MySSO.com (no longer available). It
  demonstrated cross-domain Web single sign on based on an LDAP directory. It
  had its own limitations. The client couldn't always identify login "fields"
  and we were endlessly tinkering to keep it working. But it did work on a wide
  variety of popular Web sites and we used it for a long time with great
  success.

  MySSO.com didn't rely on cookies. It used LDAP sessions that could be easily
  and strongly secured and worked with the existing authentication mechanisms on
  the sites. It did not require adoption of an authentication technology by the
  Web. The technology was on the user side. Symas felt (feels) it is important
  that the apps need not be changed. We believe Enterprises won't rework
  existing apps (Web or otherwise) and that security / Identity Management has
  to support what is, not what could or should be.

  I (we) measure Web SSO approaches against MySSO.com. It was too limited, in
  our experience, to be satisfying. Without a solution for the rest of the
  sign-on problem (email, database, legacy non-Web apps), we feared that
  adoption would be limited. We liked MySSO.com but it wasn't enough, even for
  us. It turned out, in the end, to be a toy and we turned our attention to
  OpenLDAP and the challenges of the Enterprise Directory Services platform for
  the time being.
