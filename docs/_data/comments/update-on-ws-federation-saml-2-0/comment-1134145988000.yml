  A customers perspective is slightly different than what you suggest in your
  posting. MS is doing the right things with WS-Federation. After all, if you
  consider that 99.9% of all Fortune enterprises and their B2B partners have AD
  installed, they would eliminate not only the need for SAML but for enterprises
  to buy yet another piece of software that really should be bundled with the OS
  in order to solve for problems across enterprises.

  Federated identity conversation is somewhat consumer focused. Would be great
  if participants could put on an enterprise lens when considering solutions....
