  <p>:-) 2 out of three is not bad going!</p>

  <p>The older Lagavulin's are interesting - a bit too much iodine/seaweed for
  me, but then the sea water does hit the side of the bonded warehouses - there
  is pretty much no landmass from the shore to Nova Scotia, so they get some
  pretty big weather there... </p>

  <p>Looking forward to seeing FAM </p>

  <p>regards<br/>
