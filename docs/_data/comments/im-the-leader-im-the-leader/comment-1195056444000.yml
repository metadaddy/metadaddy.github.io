  <p>I like it, Callum. Yeah - the goal is that OpenSSO matures into a 16 year
  old Lagavulin by the time it becomes Federated Access Manager 8.0. Hopefully
  it will take less than 6 years!</p>

  <p>As for your puzzle... #1 is CA (Nete as was) SiteMinder, #2 has to be
  IBM/Tivoli. #3... Hmm... Novell, maybe? Oracle/Oblix?</p>

  <p>I'll send your comment on to Earl and Ray at Gartner. Who knows, maybe
  they'll change the magic quadrant format next time round? ;-)</p>
