  <p>I'm currently evaluating Access Managers for a large scottish financial
  firm and found Pat's blog really useful.  Since we both have an appreciation
  for single malts, thought I'd add this. </p>

  <p>If only gartner would classify according to malt whisky:</p>

  <p>OpenSSO Build 1: a high proof 10year old islay - firey in places, a bit
  harsh round the edges and has no labeling on the bottle - although, if you
  search around, you will find bits of information in the still house and in
  some bars.</p>

  <p>Sun AM 7.1:  an older and smoother highland malt, like a dalwhinnie or
  perhaps a glenturret, in a nice display box with accompanying booklet on how
  it was made and how to drink it.  Not everyone would have heard of it, but
  those that do rave about it.</p>

  <p>See if you can guess the rest:<br/>

  Web Access Manager 1: of campbeltown origin, old and accomplished but bloody
  hard to find this side of sotherby's.  costs each time you take a sip but
  oddly enough a lot of people have it.  Perhaps an old Springbank.</p>

  <p>Web Access Manager 2: comes with glass, leather chair, carpet, a fireplace
  and indeed an entire island off the west coast.  Doesn't really work by
  without it all.  The top can only be unscrewed by any of the distillery's
  consultancy staff.</p>

  <p>Web Access Manager 3: buy 1 get 5 free from the student bar.  This vatted
  malt 3 year old has a 90% grain blend although you will have to add some
  flavouring yourself.  It is completely transparent like a glengoyne, could
  strip paint - but the kids love it.</p>

  <p>thanks!<br/>
