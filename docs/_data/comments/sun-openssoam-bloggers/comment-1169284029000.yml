  Hi Varun, please go to <a
  href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList"
  rel="nofollow">OpenSSO Mailing Lists</a>, sign up for users@opensso and ask
  this question there. I'm on vacation right now, so can't help you here at all.
  In general, the users@opensso mailing list is by far the best venue for these
  sort of questions.
