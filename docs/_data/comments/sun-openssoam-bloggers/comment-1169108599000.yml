  Hai

  I am new to this OpenSso.

  I have successfully installed GlassFish Application server and when i am
  trying to deploy opensso.war into it the directory structure should be

  CVS/        legal/      lightbulb/  products/   resources/  www/

  but what i am getting is completely different.

  I am stuck at this point.

  please help me

  regards

  varun
