  Hi James. Yes, my expectation is that, at some point, Open Federation will
  indeed support OpenID. One of our committers is keen to do exactly that. It's
  lower on our priority list than, say, WS-Federation and SAML/XACML, but
  there's no real hesitation there. That's the beauty of open source, if someone
  somewhere wants to do it, then it will get done.
