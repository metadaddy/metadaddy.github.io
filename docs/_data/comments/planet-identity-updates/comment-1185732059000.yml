  <p>I did indeed consider it - in fact I asked <a
  href="http://blogs.sun.com/lskrocki/" rel="nofollow">Linda</a> about getting
  onto the <a href="http://planet.sun.com/" rel="nofollow">planet.sun.com</a>
  infrastructure, but it wasn't feasible - I would have had to change the URLs
  for both the page and the feed.</p><p>I'll take a look at running Planet
  Roller on the current hosted infrastructure... it might just be doable...
  thanks for the 'prod' :-)</p>
