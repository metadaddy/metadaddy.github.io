  Hi Pat,

    Thanks..that was a great starting point for me...Please suggest any enhancement that I can do on this code where I can go much deeper into device driver modules domain...

  Also, on command line we have M=`pwd` where M=current directory. What this
  command option informs?


  I am  new to device driver programming. As per another member who commented
  above, it doesnâ€™t handle though is a detach/rmmod while an I/O is in progress.
  What does it exactly mean? How do we test it?


  Please advice,


  Thanks
