  Thank you for this, great job and it works properly.

  I try to run this driver on two machines, to impliment something like NBD
  "network block device"

  the problem is that if I am in the method sbd_transfer, "if I try to open a 
  udp socket the system crashes and blocks completely. If i do this another
  where there is no problem

  do you have any idea??
