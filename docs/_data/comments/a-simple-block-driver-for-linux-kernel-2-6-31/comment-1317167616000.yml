  Hi Yan,


  1. Did you do <code>fdisk</code> and <code>mkfs</code> to create a partition
  and filesystem respectively? It sounds like you might have forgotten one or
  both steps.


  2. I don't have any experience implementing a driver for a real hard disk -
  when I did this I was creating a network block device. You should probably
  look at the SCSI and IDE block drivers in the Linux source tree.


  Cheers,


  Pat
