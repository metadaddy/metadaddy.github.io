  Hi, 


  Thanks for sharing your experience.


  1. I am trying out my first Block Device and followed your example and it is
  asking for a filesystem type on mounting the sbd0p1 device:

  yangcomputer:~/exp # mount /dev/sbd0p1 /mnt

  mount: you must specify the filesystem type


  2. This example applies to a ramdisk. Do you have any idea how I can implement
  a similar block device on a real hard disk?   Which part of the code do I need
  to change?


  Thanks,


  Yan
