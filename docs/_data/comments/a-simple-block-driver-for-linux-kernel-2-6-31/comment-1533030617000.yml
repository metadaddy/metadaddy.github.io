  In kernel 4.10.0, you may get error like 
   error: ‘struct request’ has no member named ‘buffer’
   sbd_transfer(&amp;Device, blk_rq_pos(req), blk_rq_cur_sectors(req),req-&gt;buffer, rq_data_dir(req));
  since buffer is removed from struct request in this version. 
  Use bio_data(rq-&gt;bio) in place of req-&gt;buffer
