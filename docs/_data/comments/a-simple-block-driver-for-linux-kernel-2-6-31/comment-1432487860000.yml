  Sarge, you're code change worked fine for me. I just want to mention that your
  macro in sbd_transfer got pretty garbled in addition to your include
  statements when you posted.


  I'm assuming you were going for something like this...


  sbd_transfer(&amp;Device, blk_rq_pos(req), blk_rq_cur_sectors(req),

  #if LINUX_VERSION_CODE &lt; KERNEL_VERSION(3,15,0)

  buffer,

  #else

  bio_data(req-&gt;bio),

  #endif

  rq_data_dir(req));
