  <p>Hi pat, <br/>

  I use the OPENSSO and I am trying to integrate it to Liferay, but I am having
  some problems:<br/>

  At the time of login, the page is redirected to OPENSSO and returns to liferay
  successfully, but returns with guest user and not the user who logged in
  OPENSSO.<br/>

  You would have some advice?<br/>

  I thank the attention!<br/>

  I am using opensso 4.5 and LifeRay 5.0.1</p>
