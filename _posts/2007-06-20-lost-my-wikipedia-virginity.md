I was nosing about on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) the other day when I noticed a link to a page for [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Java_System_Access_Manager). The link went to the [standard 'editing' page](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sun_Java_System_Foobar_Manager&action=edit), so I decided to register at Wikipedia and create my first entry. Quite painless. The entry is a [stub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub), and I'm not sure how much I can add without falling foul of Wikipedia's policy on [spam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Spam). As it stands, I think the stub is useful context, particularly as [the link was already present in a couple of pages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Sun_Java_System_Access_Manager). I guess I'll sit back and see if anyone posts a [request for expansion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_expansion).
