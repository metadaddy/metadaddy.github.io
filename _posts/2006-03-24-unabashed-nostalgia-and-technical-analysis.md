I've worked for a few companies over the years (go to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/metadaddy/) for the full gory details) - one of the most fun jobs was with Synergy Real-time Systems (don't bother looking for it - it's long gone) in London. The office was in the square mile of the City of London (the financial district), a stone's throw from the Bank of England. Our core product (ok - our only product :-) ) was RITA - Real-time Interactive Technical Analysis. [Technical Analysis](http://www.investopedia.com/university/technical/) is the practice of making investment decisions based on charts of stock prices. As well as the basic price, technical analysts look at other indicators such as [moving averages](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) and more complex analyses such as [relative strength index](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) and [Bollinger bands](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp). Anyway. I was playing with [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/) the other night and discovered its [timeline](http://desktop.google.com/features.html#timeline). If you value your time, stay away! I spent a happy couple of hours googling through documents from 10 years ago. One that I found was a Word document I had emailed to my home account as a test. The document contained a RITA chart as an OCX control (OCX became ActiveX): ![](http://blog.superpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/RITA.png) The chart shows the movement of the Benetton Group's (BNG) stock on the Milan (.MI) market for the last 4 months in 1996\. The top chart is a bar chart - each red vertical line shows the high (top of the line), low (bottom of the line), open (tick on the left) and close (tick on the right) for a given time period - in this case, each day. Superimposed on the bar chart are two moving averages and a trend line. The middle chart is percentage on-balance-volume (OBV), an indicator of momentum. The bottom chart shows volume bars (green) and a moving average of the volume. Don't ask me whether the chart indicates a buy or a sell - I never could figure it out! What I did love was programming graphics. It's very rewarding working on a system where the feedback is so immediate and visual. And working in a small company of less than 10 people - hi [Ezra](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=priority_1_documentation_bug_in), Dilnaz, Mike, Matt, Chris, [John](http://www.jmnet.co.uk/), Dom, Kevin and Mike (Jenko!) (I'm sure I must have missed somebody!). And being able to go to the pick of the City's pubs after work. Ah - happy days!
