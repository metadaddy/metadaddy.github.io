*   [Brewer's CAP Theorem](http://www.julianbrowne.com/article/viewer/brewers-cap-theorem) - Nice article on Brewer's CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance - pick any two) theorem and its implications for distributed systems. Interesting to see the parallels with eventual consistency in directory services. Bonus reference to the Sex Pistols' seminal 4th June 1976 Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall gig in the intro!
