"Another OpenSSO/Access Manager/Federation Manager Blogger" ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)

Added [Warren Strange](http://blogs.sun.com/warren), Senior IT Architect up in Calgary, Alberta, to [the list](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/sun_opensso_am_bloggers). Warren has just written a [fascinating entry](http://blogs.sun.com/warren/entry/using_opensso_authentication_with_jboss) on integrating [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/) with [JBoss SEAM](http://www.jboss.com/products/seam). Well worth a read, particularly if you are working with SEAM and wondering about authentication.

Welcome, Warren!
