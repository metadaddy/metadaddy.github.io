<span style="float: right;">[![](images/Javali.png)](http://javali.org.br/)</span> I just got confirmation that I'm on the bill at the [Javali](http://javali.org.br/) event next Tuesday, June 23, in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Javali, organized by [SouJava](http://www.soujava.org.br/) and [RSJUG](http://www.rsjug.org/), focuses on Java and free software, and is held immediately prior to [FISL](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/10/www/) (on which more below). I'll be doing quite a deep dive on the secure RESTful web services (via [OAuth](http://oauth.net/)) work we have going on right now, which was first seen in public a few weeks ago at [CommunityOne West](http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone/2009/west/) and [JavaOne](http://java.sun.com/javaone/). Javali will be at the Porto Alegre [Serpro](http://www.serpro.gov.br/) offices, [Av. Augusto de Carvalho, 1133](http://www.javali.org.br/local.htm), from 09:00 to 20:00\. I'm on at 18:30 in the Bill Joy Room, just before the pizza, assuming I make my 1 hour layover in Buenos Aires!

<span style="float: left;">[![](images/FISL.png)](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/10/www/)</span> As I mentioned above, Javali precedes [FISL](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/10/www/), now in its 10th year, South America's biggest open source conference with, according to the FISL home page, over 6000 attendees registered. I spoke at [FISL 9.0](http://fislold.softwarelivre.org/9.0/www/) last April, and, I have to say, had a GREAT time. I saw an incredible display of energy and enthusiasm for all things open source, from kernel hacking to Ruby on Rails via every application of Java, although I think our evening expeditions in search of [churrasco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churrasco) and [caipirinhas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipirinha) probably also contributed to my positive recollections :-)

My session this year, 'Open Source Identity Services with OpenSSO', on Friday June 26 at 09:00 in room 40T, looks at the three different approaches we take to identity services in OpenSSO - insulating applications from identity via container plugins, support for standards such as SAML, and lightweight SOAP and REST for interacting directly with OpenSSO. I'll be covering the secure RESTful web services demo again, but it will be a much higher level view than the Javali presentation.

So - probably not enough notice for anyone to book a trip to Brazil, but, if you're going to be there anyway, drop in one one or both sessions and say "Hi"! And bring the [cacha√ßa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacha%C3%A7a)! :-)
