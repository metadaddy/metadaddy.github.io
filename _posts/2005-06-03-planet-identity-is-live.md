I took the plunge: I registered planetidentity.org, configured [Planet](http://www.planetplanet.org/) and got it working all in under 48 hours. So, go take a look at [Planet Identity](http://planetidentity.org). There seems to be an issue with entry times - Andre Durand of Ping has a load of old entries at the top, but I'm hoping that will go away as it beds in. Enjoy - and let me know if there are any other blogs you think I should add - I'm sure I've missed a load.  
Huge thanks to [Steve Lau](http://whacked.net/blog/) for contributing hosting space, and [Ludo Poitou](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/Ludo) for giving me his existing Sun internal Planet Identity as a basis. Without them I'd still be googling for hosting and scratching my head over the Planet docs.
