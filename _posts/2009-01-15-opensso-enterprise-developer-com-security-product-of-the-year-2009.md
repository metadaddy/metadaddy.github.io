[James](http://blogs.sun.com/jag/) posted earlier today on [NetBeans sweeping Developer.com's Product of the Year awards for 2009](http://blogs.sun.com/jag/entry/netbeans_rocks_the_awards). I went to take a look at the details, and what should I see, [right at the bottom of the page](http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3795991), but [OpenSSO Enterprise](http://www.sun.com/software/products/opensso_enterprise/) won Security Product of the Year! Fantastic recognition of the work that the [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) community has put in [over the last three and a half years](http://blog.superpat.com/2009/01/15/opensso-code_swarm-visualization/), still ongoing, of course, but punctuated by the [OpenSSO Enterprise 8.0 release in November](http://blog.superpat.com/2008/11/12/opensso-enterprise-8-0-released/). It's particularly gratifying to read "_This year there were no close calls. Each winner won its category with a respectable margin._".

So... Congratulations to [NetBeans](http://netbeans.org/) (my IDE of choice, of course!), and also to [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/), which won the Database Tool award with [MySQL workbench](http://dev.mysql.com/workbench/)... And THANK YOU to everyone who voted for OpenSSO Enterprise!
