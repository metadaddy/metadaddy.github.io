I had just retrieved my suitcase from the baggage carousel at Narita, when I saw a familiar face. I just had to wander up and ask "Excuse me, are you [Richard Stallman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman)?" - and it was! He was kind enough to pose for a very inexpertly taken picture (note - the iPhone isn't very good for self-portraits!) and mentioned that he is speaking in Tokyo this week - [The Free Software Movement and Its Future](http://www.fsf.org/events/20071024tokyo/view) on Wednesday October 24th in Akihabara. I may just wander along...
