I just read in John McLaughlin's latest [Sun SystemNews](http://sun.systemnews.com/) email newsletter that [Sun Java Composite Application Platform Suite](http://www.sun.com/software/javaenterprisesystem/javacaps/) (Java CAPS) received the [SWIFTReady Gold Label for Financial Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)](http://www.swift.com/index.cfm?item_id=2453#EAI) for the ninth year in a row.

Apart from the fact that this is a great achievement for Java CAPS, the news made me smile for another reason. Back in the [Trustbase](http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2000-02/sunflash.20000207.i2.xml) days (heh - just found a [Bloor report on Trustbase](http://www.bloor-research.com/research/product_evaluation/134/jcp_trustbase.html), if you're really keen to know more - free registration required), I got to visit [SWIFT](http://www.swift.com/) a couple of times. If you ever get the chance to see their headquarters at [La Hulpe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Hulpe), just outside Brussels, then GO! It's amazing, [like a Bond villain's lair](http://www.bofill.com/website-ingles/proyectos/swift.htm). You expect the tennis courts to slide back to reveal a rocket launch pad. And the cafeteria. Wow! Puts even the [Googleplex](http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/fortune/0701/gallery.Googleplex_campus/7.html) to shame ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)
