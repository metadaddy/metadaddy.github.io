These are my links for November 6th 2009:

*   [Remus - Transparent High Availability for Xen](http://nss.cs.ubc.ca/remus/) - Remus provides transparent, comprehensive high availability to ordinary virtual machines running on the Xen virtual machine monitor. It does this by maintaining a completely up-to-date copy of a running VM on a backup server, which automatically activates if the primary server fails
*   [OpenSSL is written by monkeys](http://www.peereboom.us/assl/html/openssl.html) - Marco Peereboom's rant on OpenSSL. To be honest, looking at the examples of OpenSSL code, it's difficult to disagree - sorry, Ben!
