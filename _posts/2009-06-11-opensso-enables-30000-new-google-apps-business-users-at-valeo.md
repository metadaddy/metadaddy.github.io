Among the [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/)-related news items that popped up while [I had my head down over the past few weeks](back-after-javaone-2009), I noticed the [Google Blog entry](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/30000-new-google-apps-business-users-at.html) and [Valeo press release](http://www.valeo.com/en/press-releases/details.html?id=100) concerning the global industrial group's [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html) deployment - 30,000 Valeo employees now have access to a new communication and collaborative working platform based on Google Apps Premier Edition and supported by [Capgemini](http://www.capgemini.com/), one of the largest enterprise deployments of Google Apps to date.

It's not mentioned in either story, but, if you a regular reader of [Superpatterns](http://blog.superpat.com/), you'll already know that [Capgemini deployed OpenSSO at Valeo](opensso-deployments-around-europe) to handle single sign-on, allowing Valeo employees to access their email at Google via their Valeo credentials, without having to manage a separate Google username/password.

If you're looking at Google Apps, [click here](http://www.sun.com/offers/details/google_apps_opensso.xml) to download the 'starter kit' we recently produced, which explains exactly how to set up single sign-on to Google Apps using OpenSSO.
