[Mark Wahl](http://www.ldap.com/1/commentary/wahl/) [left a comment](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/comments/superpat/Weblog/sun_microsoft_press_conference#comment13) asking how interested parties can comment on and contribute to the [recently released web single sign-on interoperability specifications](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat/20050514#sun_microsoft_press_conference). Well, Sun and Microsoft have established a Yahoo group for this purpose at [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/WebSSO-Workshops/](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/WebSSO-Workshops/). You will have to fill out a participation agreement to sign up to the workshop group - IP stuff I guess - I can't comment on that right now as I haven't seen the agreement.
