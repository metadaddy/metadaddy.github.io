Despite being on vacation this week, I had to post this one - [Neil Macehiter's assessment of Sun's Identity Management business](http://www.mwdadvisors.com/blog/2005/04/killer-app-for-sun-in-identity.html). Neil gives a good overview of Identity Management at Sun since the Waveset acquisition, and points out the challenges ahead. All I can say is, watch this space, Neil!
