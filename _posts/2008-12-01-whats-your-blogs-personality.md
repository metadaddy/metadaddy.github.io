<div style="margin: 5px; float: right;">[![](http://blog.superpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ISTJ-250.gif)](http://www.typealyzer.com/)</div>

[Doc](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/) [points to](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2008/11/30/fun-with-personalities/) [his Linux Journal entry](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/keeping-linux-safe-1994-0) in which he discusses [Typealyzer](http://www.typealyzer.com/), a site that, given your blog URL, divines its 'personality' as a [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator) (MBTI). Of course, the first thing I did was to point it at myself, with somewhat surprising results. According to Typealyzer, [Superpatterns](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/) is [ISTJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISTJ) - a '[Duty Fulfiller](http://www.personalitypage.com/ISTJ.html)'. From Typealyzer:

> The responsible and hardworking type. They are especially attuned to the details of life and are careful about getting the facts right. Conservative by nature they are often reluctant to take any risks whatsoever.
> 
> The Duty Fulfillers are happy to be let alone and to be able to work in their own pace. They know what they have to do and how to do it.

Now, I consistently test as [ENTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENTP) - the '[Visionary](http://www.personalitypage.com/ENTP.html)' - hands waving in the air in front of the whiteboard, the opposite of Superpatterns on every axis except 'thinking', in fact. I suppose Superpatterns must be where I reveal my quiet, methodical side :-)
