You might have seen the news today that [Sun just released Java Enterprise System 5](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/03-01-2007/0004537344&EDATE=). While it's not called out in the press release, [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/) 7.1 is part of [Java ES 5](http://www.sun.com/software/javaenterprisesystem/index.jsp). Although it's been widely previewed in beta in the [Netbeans Enterprise Pack](http://www.netbeans.org/products/enterprise/) and [Java EE SDK](http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/index.jsp), it's still worth calling out the [new features](http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-4683/6n6qn8566?a=view):

*   Java ES Monitoring Framework Integration - capture and monitor statistics and service-related data - "How many failed authentications have there been in the last 24 hours?"
*   Web Service Security - well covered [here](http://blogs.sun.com/page/theaquarium?anchor=securing_communications_in_web_services), [here](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/sun_developer_network_channel_identity) and [here](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/access_manager_7_1_beta).
*   Single Access Manager WAR file deployment - this was introduced in [Sun Java System Federation Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/federation_mgr/) 7.0 - install Access Manager by just deploying a [WAR file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_(file_format)) into a [suitable web container](http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-4683/6n6qn8567?a=view) and [filling out a few fields in the configurator page](http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-5899/6n7uuthas?a=view).
*   Enhancements to Core Services - [Loads of goodies](http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-4683/6n6qn8567?a=view#gcqjr), including new container support, new load balancing features and much more.

So, go to the [download page](http://www.sun.com/software/javaenterprisesystem/getit.jsp), grab Access Manager 7.1 and give it a whirl. It's in all of the system/suite downloads except the availability suite.
