I'm supposed to be packing for a trip right now, rather than blogging, so I can't write much, but [Terry](http://blogs.sun.com/tls/), [Scott](http://blogs.sun.com/sfehrman/) (dude - you need to put your blogging hat back on) and [Derrick](http://blogs.sun.com/harcey/) would never forgive me if I missed this. Suffice to say - [OpenPTK](http://openptk.dev.java.net/) is _very_ cool, and you can find out much more about it in the following blog posts:
