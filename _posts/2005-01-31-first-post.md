OK - so I've joined the weblog revolution. Some of this will relate to work stuff - federated identity and Sun's Java System Access Manager product - and some to my 'outside' interests - single malt scotch whisky, my favourite toys and my observations on being a Brit abroad in Silicon Valley.  

So - sit back and enjoy the ride :-)
