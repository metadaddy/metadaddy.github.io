Crack Sun identity management field operatives [Paul Walker](http://blogs.sun.com/illgetmycoat/) and [Joachim Andres](http://blogs.sun.com/JoachimAndres/) have put together [an amazing demo](http://blogs.sun.com/illgetmycoat/entry/sun_idm_virtual_desktop_infrastructure) of [Sun's identity stack](http://www.sun.com/software/products/identity/index.jsp) working with [Sun xVM](http://www.sun.com/software/products/xvm/index.jsp) and [Secure Global Desktop](http://www.sun.com/software/products/sgd/index.jsp) to provision (and disable!) 'Desktops in the Cloud' to end users. It's an integration tour de force, bringing together a whole slew of Sun products into a whole that is much more than the sum of its parts. Cool soundtrack too - [well worth 12 minutes of your time](http://blogs.sun.com/illgetmycoat/entry/sun_idm_virtual_desktop_infrastructure). Oh - and make sure you view 'full screen', so you can properly see what's happening - there's quite a lot going on!
