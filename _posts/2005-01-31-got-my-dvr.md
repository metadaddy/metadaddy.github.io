Well, we're probably the last people in Silicon Valley to do so, but we finally got a DVR ([Digital Video Recorder](https://www.comcast.com/Benefits/CableDetails/Slot3PageOne.asp)). We've had cable (TV and internet) from Comcast since we arrived in California, but only got round to adding the DVR box last week.  

So far, I have to admit, I'm impressed. It 'just works'. I especially like the way that, if we're a few minutes into a show, and something comes up (with a 3 year old and a 6 month old, something _always_ comes up!) I can press record and it records the show. _From the beginning_ - great!  

As far as I can see, it doesn't guess what you like and record it for you (like the Tivo box), but I'm not so sure I like that anyway. I don't have time to watch the stuff I record myself, let alone someone else's suggestions :-)  

Anyway - I'm off to catch up with [Desperate Housewives](http://abc.go.com/primetime/desperate/) - bye for now!
