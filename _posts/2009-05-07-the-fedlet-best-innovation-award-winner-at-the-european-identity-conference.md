Sitting next to [The Smoking Monkey](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/) here at [Sun's Open IAM day in Brussels](http://be.sun.com/sunnews/events/2009/openiamdays/index.jsp), I just got word that [the Fedlet](http://tinyurl.com/fedlet) last night won the 'Best Innovation' award at the [European Identity Conference 2009](http://www.id-conf.com/eic2009). [In Kuppinger Cole's words](http://www.id-conf.com/blog/2009/05/07/awards-for-outstanding-identity-management-projects/):

> **In the category “Best innovation”,** the award went to the OpenSSO initative, founded and supported by Sun Microsystems. Their project, OpenSSO Fedlet has provided a lean solution for the Identity Federation.

This capped a fantastic week for us at EIC2009 - our second OpenSSO Community Day, hosted here on Tuesday, was a great success, with about 50 attendees coming together for a full day of presentations and discussions centering on OpenSSO. I've started uploading slides to [the event wiki page](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/OpenSSO+Community+Day+-+Munich+-+May+5+2009) - more will arrive over the next few days as I receive them from the presenters.

[Felix Gaehtgens](http://blogs.kuppingercole.com/gaehtgens/) managed to corner me on the Sun booth on Wednesday - here's what I had to say about the OpenSSO Community Day and the latest Fedlet news:
