_UPDATE_ - it's a challenge - [IBM vs Sun](http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/2007/10/18/now-its-a-game-an-ibm-vs-sun-game-dopplr-meets-cagefightr/). Let's beat them down!!!

[James Governor](http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/) writes today, [encouraging IBM'ers to sign up](http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/2007/10/18/if-you-work-at-ibm-and-travel-a-lot-then-sign-up-for-the-dopplr-service/) to [Dopplr](http://www.dopplr.com/). Chatting with James, the sentiment is by no means exclusive to IBM - Sun is also a member of the '[Dopplr 100](http://www.dopplr.com/100)' - any Sun employee can sign up to Dopplr with their Sun email address, no invite needed. Here is a tweaked version of James' call to action, explaining why you need Dopplr...

> Dopplr is a really cool application that makes it easier for distributed teams to get together. Its essentially a trip planning application but with a strong social element. Do you ever go to a city and then a week later find out that someone on your team was there too and you didn't know it? Sun today is a truly globalised company, and I know this happens a lot. Many is the time I have seen a Sun person really happy to finally meet someone they have worked closely together for years. So why not accelerate your serendipity with Dopplr.

> Dopplr is currently still in limited beta (isn't everything cool) and normally people can't register unless they are invited. But  
> but the firm is savvy enough to have introduce what it calls the [Dopplr 100](http://www.dopplr.com/100) - that is 100 firms that can self-register. That is Dopplr is saying Sun is one of the cool kids. Sign up [here](http://www.dopplr.com/100).

> Further disclosure: Matt will think I am super lame if none of you sign up. So get to it.
