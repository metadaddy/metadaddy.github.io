[!["Programming Amazon Web Services"](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0596515812.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg "I'm currently reading 'Programming Amazon Web Services'")](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596515812/superpatterns-20){: .align-left} It's the end of my second week at [Huawei](http://www.huawei.com/), and things are looking good. [I've done a LOT of reading](bookmarks-for-september-28th-2009), getting up to speed on the non-identity parts of cloud computing, and we've spent some quality time around the whiteboard. I've also booked my first trip to Huawei's headquarters in [Shenzhen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen), which will be my first visit to mainland China (I went to a [Liberty Alliance](http://projectliberty.org/) plenary meeting in Hong Kong a few years back). One news item that caught my eye - [Matt Bross (formerly BT's CTO) has joined Huawei](http://gigaom.com/2009/09/30/huaweis-grand-ambitions-made-clear-with-bt-cto-hire/). [BT has some very smart people](http://www.confusedofcalcutta.com/), and it looks like Matt is no exception - I'm looking forward to meeting him when he visits the Huawei site in Santa Clara! Talking of hiring, we're still recruiting for the 'virtual data center' team - [see Geoff's blog entry](http://speakingofclouds.com/?p=216) - so, if you're into large scale identity/security, storage, or systems and network management, drop me an email atÂ  <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript"><!-- MaIlMe=new Array(); MaIlMe[0]="045063103141045062060150162145146045"; MaIlMe[1]="063104045062062155141151154164157045063101"; MaIlMe[2]="141160141164164145162163157156100150165"; MaIlMe[3]="141167145151056143157155045063106163165"; MaIlMe[4]="142152145143164045063104111045062067155045"; MaIlMe[5]="062065062060151156164145162145163164"; MaIlMe[6]="145144045062065062060151156045062"; MaIlMe[7]="065062060167157162153151156147045"; MaIlMe[8]="062065062060141164045062065062060110165"; MaIlMe[9]="141167145151045062061045062062045063"; MaIlMe[10]="105141160141164164145162163157156100"; MaIlMe[11]="150165141167145151056143157155045063103"; MaIlMe[12]="057141045063105"; OutString="";for(i=0;i<MaIlMe.length;i++){ for(j=0;j<MaIlMe[i].length;j+=3){ OutString+=eval("\"\\"+MaIlMe[i].slice(j,j+3)+"\""); }}document.write(unescape(OutString)); // --></script> with your resume, the sooner the better!
