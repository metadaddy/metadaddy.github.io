It's been a while since the last [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) article at [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/) (the excellent, three-part, [Troubleshooting OpenSSO with Firefox Add-Ons](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/troubleshooting.html)), but [Malla](http://blogs.sun.com/malla/) and [Rick](http://blogs.sun.com/rikart/) have come up trumps with [Securing REST Web Services With OAuth](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/restwebservices.html).

The article recasts the tried and true 'stock quote sample' as a RESTful web service with access protected by [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) via OpenSSO and [Jersey](https://jersey.dev.java.net/) (Sun's open source implementation of JAX-RS, aka [JSR 311](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=311)). This is technology that has hitherto only been demonstrated in a [demo at JavaOne 2009](back-after-javaone-2009), so it's great to see it being successfully applied here.

[Go read the article](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/restwebservices.html) and discover how OpenSSO, Jersey and OAuth combine to secure RESTful web services!
