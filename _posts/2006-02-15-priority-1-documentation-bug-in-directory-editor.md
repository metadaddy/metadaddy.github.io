Warning - for mature audiences only. The following post contains material of a juvenile nature and should not be viewed by anyone lacking a sense of humour. If you're really quick, you'll catch a [P1 documentation bug in Sun Java System Directory Editor](http://docs.sun.com/source/819-1701/03_GettingStarted.html#wp1233617) just before it's fixed. Here's a cap in case the real page is gone by the time you read this (click to enlarge): [![](http://blog.superpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Browse_page_small.gif)](http://blog.superpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Browse_page.gif) Now, that first entry under 'People' _really_ shouldn't be there... ðŸ˜ƒ The screenshot was taken of a 'development' directory - I'm guessing the engineer was testing a quoted multi-word field in 'firstname' and just typed in the first thing that came to mind... Anyway, some context, for the non-British English speakers out there:

*   Bollocks = testicles
*   Dog's bollocks = excellent, as in "This beer is the dog's bollocks, mate!"
*   [Directory Editor](http://www.sun.com/software/products/directory_srvr_ee/dir_editor/index.xml) = A J2EE-based web application that enables you to quickly and easily manage directory data. Ships as part of [Sun Java System Directory Server Enterprise Edition](http://www.sun.com/software/products/directory_srvr_ee/index.xml).
*   Ezra Simeloff = Top developer, now in the Sun Identity Manager team. Truly, Ez _is_ the dog's bollocks when it comes to Java programming.

So - a lesson to us all - carefully proofread screenshots before they go live. ðŸ˜ƒ
