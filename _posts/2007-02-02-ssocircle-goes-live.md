Hu Liu, a regular on the OpenSSO IRC channel ([#opensso on freenode](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensso)), has just launched [SSOCircle](http://www.ssocircle.com/) - a [SAML 2.0](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security#samlv20) identity provider (IdP), based on the [Open Federation](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=4377) code (part of the [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/) project). Quoting from the home page, SSOCircle's mission is:

> *   Identity Provider for everyone
> *   JumpStart SingleSignOn/Federation deployments
> *   Leverage federation for Web 2.0 apps
> *   Providing ready-to-use solutions
> *   SAML 2.0 standard based testing platform
> *   Exchange of information/experience
> *   Building the **SSOCircle** of Trust

I just registered, logged in and tried out SAML 2.0 SSO with the [sample service provider site](http://cgi-service-provider.saml2.com/cgi-bin/zxid) (based on Sampo Kellom√§ki of [Symlabs](http://www.symlabs.com/)' [ZXID](http://zxid.org/)) and it all works nicely. At last there is an easy to use, public site to play with SAML 2.0\.

As soon as I get a chance I'm going to add SSOCircle as the default IdP in [Lightbulb](https://lightbulb.dev.java.net/) and write a how-to for getting your first service provider up and running.

Thanks, Hu, and best of luck!
