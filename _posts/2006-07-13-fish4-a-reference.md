[Rohan](http://rohanpinto.com/) pointed me to [this story about UK site Fish4 having problems](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/13/fish4_goes_down/) with their [E6900](http://www.sun.com/servers/midrange/sunfire_e6900/index.jsp). I guess we'll take that one on the chin (wonder what the first person plural of 'mea culpa' is?), but it set me wondering... If Fish4 are happy to point the finger when things go wrong, they should really give us some acknowledgement when things are going well. Perhaps someone in UK sales can email them a little 'Powered by Sun' graphic. Just like the one at [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/).

_UPDATE_ - See [Rohan's take here](http://www.rohanpinto.com/?p=761) - in response to Rohan: it's quite possible that Fish4 have Linux on the web tier backing onto an E6900\.
