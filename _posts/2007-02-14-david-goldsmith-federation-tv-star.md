Thanks to [Charles](http://cld.blog-city.com/) for [this pointer](http://cld.blog-city.com/new_video__identity_federation.htm) (and to [Dennis](http://blogs.sun.com/justme/) for pointing it out): [David Goldsmith](http://blogs.sun.com/openroad/) does a great job in [this video](http://wcdata.sun.com/webcast/download/podcast/07B00878/07B00878_02.mp4) explaining the problems inherent in the proliferation of online identities and how federation and Sun's product line ([Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/) and [Sun Java System Federation Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/federation_mgr/)) address them. After working through a couple of real-world examples, David goes on to provide useful definitions of common federation buzzwords, such as 'circle of trust', 'identity provider' and 'service provider'. Well worth watching if you want to get up to speed quickly! [Click here for the video](http://wcdata.sun.com/webcast/download/podcast/07B00878/07B00878_02.mp4).
