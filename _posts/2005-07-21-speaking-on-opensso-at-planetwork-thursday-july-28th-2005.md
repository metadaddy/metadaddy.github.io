I'll be speaking on OpenSSO at [Planetwork](http://www.planetwork.net/) in San Francisco next Thursday, July 28th 2005\. Here is the complete announcement I received from [Kaliya Hamlin](http://www.identitywoman.net/):

> **July Planetwork FOCUS on DIGITAL IDENTITY TOOLS**  
> Thursday, July 28th doors at 6, program at 7, networking from 8-10

>   
> Kaliya Hamlin, [the Identity Woman](http://www.identitywoman.net), curated this line up that provides a great opportunity to learn more about some of the latest tools for next generation digital identity.

> **Light Weight Identity - LID**  
> [Johannes Ernst](http://netmesh.info/jernst) [NetMesh Inc.](http://lid.netmesh.org/)  
> Light-Weight Identity(tm)-- LID(tm)-- a new and very simple digital identity protocol that puts users in control of their own digital identities, without reliance on a centralized party and without approval from an "identity provider".  
>   
> **OpenID**  
> [Brad Fitzpatrick](http://bradfitz.com/) [Six Apart, Ltd.](http://www.sixapart.com/)  
> OpenID, a decentralized identity system, but one that's actually decentralized and doesn't entirely crumble if one company turns evil or goes out of business. An OpenID identity is just a URL.  
>   
> **Sun Single Sign On**  
> [Pat Patterson](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat) [Sun Microsystems](http://opensso.dev.java.net/)  
> Sun is announcing the intention to open source web single sign-on. This project, called Open Web Single Sign-On, or OpenSSO, gives developers access to the source code to these basic identity services allows them to focus on innovations that solve more urgent problems, such as securely connecting partner networks, ensuring user privacy, and proving compliance.  
>   
> **Opinity, Inc**  
> [Ted Cho](http://www.opinity.com)  
> Opinity provides what might be called open reputation for end users. It is a young start up offering free online reputation management related services so that individuals can authenticate, aggregate, and mobilize their website (eBay, Amazon, etc.) reputations. Opinity also offers reputation management tools so that individuals can monitor, build, and work to enhance their own reputation going forward. Individuals can also review other individuals at the Opinity website.  
>   
> Planetwork has been hosting monthly networking forums in the Bay Area for the last 3 years. We are a unique network sitting at the nexus of technology use for social and environmental good. To support the monthly forums we invite voluntary donations (in a basket on the food table).  
>   
> If you would like to join our mailing list to get more information about upcoming events please go to [this page](http://www.planetwork.net/community/index.html) and get a planetwork i-name.

So, come along, throw a few bucks into the basket, listen to me and my fellow speakers and stay for a chat.
