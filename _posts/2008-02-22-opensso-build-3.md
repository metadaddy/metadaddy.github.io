Yay! [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org) v1 Build 3 was released yesterday - as already reported by [Tatsuo](http://blogs.sun.com/tkudo/entry/opensso_v1_build_3) and [Michael](http://blogs.sun.com/docteger/entry/opensso_build_2_is_gone). As ever, binaries are available at the [OpenSSO download page](https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/use/index.html).

[Here's a full list of fixes in build 3](https://opensso.dev.java.net/issues/buglist.cgi?Submit+query=Submit+query&component=opensso&issue_status=RESOLVED&issue_status=VERIFIED&issue_status=CLOSED&version=current&target_milestone=FAM-8.0-build-3&email1=&emailtype1=exact&emailassigned_to1=1&email2=&emailtype2=exact&emailreporter2=1&issueidtype=include&issue_id=&changedin=&votes=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&short_desc=&short_desc_type=fulltext&long_desc=&long_desc_type=fulltext&issue_file_loc=&issue_file_loc_type=fulltext&status_whiteboard=&status_whiteboard_type=fulltext&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=&cmdtype=doit&newqueryname=&order=Reuse+same+sort+as+last+time); the big new features in this release are [issue 1375](https://opensso.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1375): SAML2 Attribute Query and [issue 1533](https://opensso.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1533): SAML2 Authentication Query and NameID Mapping profile, rounding out our [industry-leading support of SAML 2.0](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/fam_8_0_puts_the), plus support for JBoss 4.x and Geronimo 2.0.2\. See the [release notes](http://download.java.net/general/opensso/stable/openssov1-build3/B3-ReleaseNotes.html) for more.

While we're on the subject of OpenSSO and the forthcoming [FAM 8.0](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/federated_access_manager_roadmap), Michael has put together a nice little series of articles derived from the recent FAM 8.0 'transfer of information' (TOI) from engineering to other stakeholders like QA, docs and training:

*   [Federated Access Manager TOI, Session 1](http://blogs.sun.com/docteger/entry/federated_access_manager_toi_session)
*   [Federated Access Manager TOI, Session 2](http://blogs.sun.com/docteger/entry/federated_access_manager_toi_session1)
*   [Federated Access Manager TOI, Session 3](http://blogs.sun.com/docteger/entry/federated_access_manager_toi_session3)

Michael's blog is well worth the subscription - handy hints on OpenSSO and the Federated Access Manager product line [accompanied by classic choonz](http://blogs.sun.com/docteger/entry/updated_opensso_faq). What more could you want?
