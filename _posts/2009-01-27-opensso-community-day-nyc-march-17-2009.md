**Join us for the very first OpenSSO Community Day!**

Hosted by [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu/) at the [Kimmel Center](http://www.nyu.edu/kimmel.center/index.html) in Greenwich Village, New York, and sponsored by [Sun Microsystems](http://www.sun.com/), this is an opportunity for [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) contributors, deployers and users to come together in an informal '[unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)' setting.

Being an unconference, the only rigid item on the agenda is to decide at 9am on the sessions for the rest of the day. You can show up and talk about any OpenSSO-related topic you like. Maybe you have an interesting deployment, a new extension or a nagging question - sessions can be discussions as much as presentations. Now, that doesn't mean that there need be zero preparation - if you have a session in mind, [go to the wiki](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/OpenSSO+Community+Day+-+NYC+-+March+17+2009) and add it there, so folks can get an idea of the likely content ahead of time. [We've already posted a few ideas](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/OpenSSO+Community+Day+-+NYC+-+March+17+2009).

All are welcome, attendance is free, and continental breakfast plus lunch will be provided. We'll likely adjourn to a nearby bar at the end of the day to continue the conversation :-)

[We're using meetup.com to manage the registration process](http://www.meetup.com/opensso/calendar/9588430/) - just join the OpenSSO group and RSVP. And don't delay - 5 of the 40 places are already gone!
