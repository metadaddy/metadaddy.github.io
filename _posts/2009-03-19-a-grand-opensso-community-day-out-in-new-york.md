Many thanks to all who attended (I counted at least 50) and spoke at our very first [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) Community Day this past Tuesday in New York City, and to [NYU](http://www.nyu.edu/) for making available [such an excellent facility](http://www.nyu.edu/kimmel.center/). We had a range of speakers: some from the OpenSSO product team, some from other parts of Sun, and even one SI partner - Mike Schwartz from [ID-Vault](http://www.id-vault.us/). As promised, we assembled the agenda at the start of the day, and managed to fit in nine 40 minute sessions covering pretty much every aspect of OpenSSO. Almost all the slides are online at the [event wiki page](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/OpenSSO+Community+Day+-+NYC+-+March+17+2009) (slides, please, Brad!). If you attended the community day, please [complete the Meetup survey](http://www.meetup.com/opensso/events/survey/?eventId=9588430) - we'd love to have your rating and comments. [The next stop for the OpenSSO Community Day roadshow will be Munich, on May 5](opensso-community-day-2-0-munich-may-5-2009). Remember, if you're also planning to attend the [European Identity Conference](https://www.id-conf.com/eic2009) (hosts for our event), you can get 20% off your registration fee by quoting the discount code **OPENSSO**. Watch this space for news of OpenSSO Community Day 3.0 - to be held in San Francisco, around the time of [CommunityOne West](http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone/2009/west/)/[JavaOne](http://java.sun.com/javaone/).
