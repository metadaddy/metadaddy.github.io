If you've visited [Planet Identity](http://planetidentity.org/) yet then you'll probably have noticed that it's inherited the same look as [Planet Sun](http://planetsun.org/) - not surprising, since I just reused the PS code. Now, I have pretty limited graphical talent - as you can probably see from my almost-standard Sotto theme. This is where you come in - if you have a modicum of artistic flair, and feel like contributing a new look for Planet Identity, I'd like to hear from you. I can't pay you, but I'll give you full credit on the page, and your work will be seen by thousands... ok, hundreds... well, a few people every day.  
Incidentally - this is my first post using [BlogEd](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bblfish/20050530#final_beta_of_bloged_0) - if you can read this then it's working.
