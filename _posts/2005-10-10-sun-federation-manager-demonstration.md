My previous job at Sun (until January 2005) was as technical product manager for [Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml ). The main reason I moved back to engineering to take a technical architect role was so that my business card didn't read like a tongue-twister ![:-)](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/images/smileys/smile.gif ":-)"). Anyway - I still dabble on the technical marketing side, helping out when things get busy over there, like last month's technical sales training <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">boondoggle</span> event in Las Vegas - two days of lectures and labs bringing together Sun's identity management marketing team and the Sun system engineers (=sales engineers) affiliated with identity management.  
My contribution (no - I didn't get to go to Vegas!) was a new front end for the [Federation Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/federation_mgr/index.xml) [Liberty Identity Federation Framework (ID-FF) single sign-on (SSO) sample](http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-2357/6n4ld08rj?a=view#frykh). This sample, shipped with Federation Manager, shows how to get Liberty ID-FF SSO working between an Identity Provider and a Service Provider. Out-of-the-box, this sample comprised a set of functional, yet plain, JSPs. I re-used some old demo layouts to give the sample a bit of pizazz so the SEs could take something away as the basis for a demo. I was going to just put up a few screenshots here to walk you, the reader, through a simple SSO scenario, but then I realised that it would actually be less work to use [Qarbon](http://www.qarbon.com)'s [Viewletbuilder](http://www.qarbon.com/presentation-software/viewletbuilder/) to whip up a flash presentation. So - here it is - just click on the screen below and discover the magic of federated single sign-on...
