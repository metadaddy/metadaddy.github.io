[Via James McGovern](http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2007/11/links-for-2007-11-17.html) comes the news that [Liferay Portal](http://www.liferay.com/portal) now supports [OpenSSO](http://opensso.dev.java.net/). [Prashant Dighe](http://blogs.sun.com/pdblog/) [blogged the recipe for integrating OpenSSO with Liferay](http://blogs.sun.com/pdblog/entry/opensso_and_liferay_integration), and [Brian Chan](http://www.liferay.com/web/bchan/home) [picked it up and rolled it into Liferay itself](http://www.liferay.com/web/bchan/home/blogs/liferay_integration_with_opensso):

> We just integrated the code snippets into Liferay so users can easily integrate with OpenSSO by just going to the Enterprise Admin portlet and entering the right settings. No more code or properties changes.

This sort of thing is just great to see - new OpenSSO integrations bubbling up from the community. Keep 'em coming!
