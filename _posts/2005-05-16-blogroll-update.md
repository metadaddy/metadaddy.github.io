Finally I have time to post some links to blogs and news feeds which I have recently discovered...

*   [Chuck Mortimore](http://xmldap.blogspot.com/). What can I say? Super-deployment engineer on Access Manager (then called Identity Server) when I moved onto the product - a sad loss to Sun when he moved to [Green Giant](http://www.bluetitan.com), or whatever they're called ![](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/images/smileys/wink.gif).
*   [Eric Norlin](http://ericnorlin.typepad.com/weblog/) is VP of Strategic Marketing at [Ping Identity](http://www.pingidentity.com). I got to meet Eric at Digital ID World last week - a nice guy and always a good read.
*   [Jamie Lewis](http://www.burtongroupblogs.com/jamielewis/) is the CEO and Research Chair of the [Burton Group](http://www.burtongroup.com/) - network/identity industry analysts. When I first got into identity management proper, as product manager of Sun's Meta-Directory, I spent the first two weeks on the job just reading Burton reports - a very efficient way to get up to speed.
*   [Anyway](http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway) - Lauren Wood's day job is senior technical program manager in the CTO's office, but she still finds time to help me out with web page layout for demos - most notably last week's Sun/Microsoft web single sign-on demo.
*   [Discovering Identity](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/identity) promises to be essential reading - Mark Dixon is a practice lead in Sun's Identity Management sales practice.
*   [tnt](http://knowidentity.typepad.com/tnt/) are [Trusted Network Technology](http://www.trustednetworktech.com/). It would be difficult to meet a nicer bunch of guys - hi Derek, Dave, Bob, Doug - and really cool technology to boot. They attach an identity token to packets at the IP level, then filter them throughout the network. A company to watch.
*   [Good Morning Silicon Valley](http://blogs.siliconvalley.com/gmsv/) - my daily dose of tech news. Always entertaining.
