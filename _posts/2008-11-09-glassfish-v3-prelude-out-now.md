So, [GlassFish V3 Prelude](http://www.sun.com/software/products/glassfishv3_prelude/get.jsp) was [announced](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-11/sunflash.20081106.1.xml) last week, just as I was wrapping up my week in Tokyo ([Liberty Alliance](http://projectliberty.org/) plenary meeting and [Liberty Alliance Day 2008](http://www.event-web.jp/LAD2008/) - more on the latter in another blog entry), so I missed the [blog fest](http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/glassfish_v3_prelude_launching_today). Oh well. Here's my contribution anyway...

You'll know by now that GlassFish v3 features a [modular architecture](http://developers.sun.com/appserver/reference/techart/glassfishv3prelude/index.html#modular) based on [OSGi](http://www.osgi.org/Main/HomePage), [Rails/Grails](https://glassfish-scripting.dev.java.net/) support, [RESTful web services](http://jersey.dev.java.net/) and much, much more. Well, here in [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/)-land [we particularly like](http://blogs.sun.com/rangal/entry/opensso_webstart_prototype) v3's [embeddability](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2008/04/glassfish_v3_ju.html) and the fact that, as far as we've observed, OpenSSO 'just works' with no changes for v3\. GlassFish v3 isn't yet on the supported platform list for [OpenSSO Enterprise 8.0](http://www.sun.com/software/products/opensso_enterprise/index.xml), but we'll be adding it in the near future.
