[![](images/mast-3.jpg){: .align-left}](http://www.catalyst.burtongroup.com/NA09/HospitalityMiniSites/Sun/index.html) [I blogged last week about Sun's hospitality suite](coming-up-burton-catalyst-conference-2009-and-don-bowen-in-san-diego) at the [Burton Catalyst](http://www.catalyst.burtongroup.com/Na09/) conference in San Diego later this month (July 29th to be exact). I included a priority code in that post that would get you a discount off Catalyst conference registration; well, with a bit of digging I've unearthed the code that will get you a pass to get into the hospitality suites (NOT the sessions, mind) **absolutely free** (and, as we all know, there's nothing better than [free](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401322905/superpatterns-20), right?). Just [register at the Burton site](https://burtongroup.wingateweb.com/us09/portal/newreg.ww?__utma=1.746192780695042800.1245875227.1246290367.1246996421.3&__utmb=1.1.10.1246996421&__utmc=1&__utmx=135213410.00004674293961679596:4:1&__utmz=1.1245875227.1.1.utmcsr=prweb.com%7Cutmccn=%28referral%29%7Cutmcmd=referral%7Cutmcct=/releases/burton_group/catalyst_conference/prweb2530924.htm&__utmv=-&__utmk=26178237) with super-_duper_ secret priority code **sun1du0w** - and, shhhhh - don't tell them you got it here ;-)
