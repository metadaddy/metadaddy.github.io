Last Friday we declared '[build 1](http://download.java.net/general/opensso/stable/fam80-build1/)' of Sun Java System Federated Access Manager 8.0\. This is the initial build (from the [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/) code) that we (engineering) handed off to QA to start the official [countdown to FAM 8.0](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/federated_access_manager_roadmap). Congratulations to both the FAM engineering team and the wider OpenSSO community on this huge milestone.

You might have seen [Daniel](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/)'s [outline of the new features in FAM 8.0](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/part_ii) - some of these goodies, such as WS-Federation and web services security, are in build 1; others, such as centralized server and agent config, will arrive later. As Daniel mentions, heterogeneity is a big focus in this release - the [release notes](http://download.java.net/general/opensso/stable/fam80-build1/B1-ReleaseNotes.html) cover installation on a host of containers - Glassfish v2/Sun Java System Application Server 9.1, Sun Java System Web Server 7.0 U1, BEA WebLogic Server 9.2 and 10.0, IBM Websphere Application Server 6.1, Oracle Application Server 10g, and Apache Tomcat 5.5.x.

So, [grab the zip](http://download.java.net/general/opensso/stable/fam80-build1/fam.zip), throw it on your favorite container and [let us know of any issues!](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues) (You'll need to be a project member to file an issue - [join OpenSSO here](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest).)
