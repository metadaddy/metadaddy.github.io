<div style="margin: 5px; float: right;">[![](http://blog.superpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/WAMMQ2008-250.png)](http://mediaproducts.gartner.com/reprints/sunmicrosystems/volume1/article1/article1.html)</div>

Another year, another [Gartner Magic Quadrant for Web Access Management](http://mediaproducts.gartner.com/reprints/sunmicrosystems/volume1/article1/article1.html). Where [2007 saw Sun Access Manager entering the leader space](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/i_m_the_leader_i), close to the leader/challenger 'cusp', this year Sun OpenSSO Enterprise is solidly in the magic leader quadrant.

[As Daniel mentions](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/sun_gartner_wam_leader_agaaaaaaain), we saw great growth this last year, so it's puzzling that they list 'flat growth' as a 'caution' for us. Then again, that is the _only_ caution, so I guess they had to find _something_ negative.

On the positive side, they list our market leadership, full range of features, leadership in open source identity, the strength of the OpenSSO community, our innovation around the [Fedlet](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/the_fedlet_has_arrived_check) and much, much more.
