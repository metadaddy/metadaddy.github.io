Late last year I recorded a segment for a Sun '[Net Talk](https://communications.sun.com/dialog/ondemandcatalog.do)' feature. The feature - [Sun Does Windows - Interoperability Delivered](https://communications.sun.com/dialog/singleeventpage.do?eventId=5921) went live a couple of days ago. [Bill Vass](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/BVass) ([Sun's CIO](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/ceo/mgt_vass.html)), Benjamin Baer (Director, Partner Operating System Marketing), John Tollefsrud (N1 Architect) and Matt Wolf (Senior Product Marketing Manager, Windows on Sun) give an overview of some of the various touch-points between Sun and Microsoft products - I present the Sun/Microsoft Web SSO Interoperability demo in segment 17\. This is essentially the same demo that Don Schmidt of Microsoft and I [presented back in May 2005](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=sun_microsoft_press_conference), but you get to see more of the actual demo applications this time round. Of course, the rest of the Net Talk is all new, so it's worth watching in its entirety.
