Unfortunately, I have other commitments on Wednesday and Thursday (just too much going on right now!), so I can't be up in SF those days.  
So, come over the Sun booth and debate [linguistic function](http://www.identityblog.com/2005/05/04.html#a213), [privacy and the Liberty Alliance Project](http://www.idcorner.org/index.php?p=97), [desktop single sign-on to federated partners](http://ericnorlin.typepad.com/weblog/2005/04/beat_that_ping.html), or just say "Hi!".
