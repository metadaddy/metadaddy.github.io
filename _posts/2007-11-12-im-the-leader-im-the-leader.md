[...I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)!!!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'm_the_Leader_of_the_Gang_(I_Am)) I know - [Gary Glitter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Glitter) has fallen long and hard, but it's still a great song and appropriate for today - [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/) has placed [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/) in the leader quadrant of their [Magic Quadrant for Web Access Management, 2H07 [PDF]](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/2h07.pdf). I happen to think that they have under-rated us somewhat on our completeness of vision, but I can't argue with the rating on ability to execute.

One thing worth mentioning is that one of the 'cons' listed for Sun - "Sun does not support ADFS/WS-Federation in its federation tools" - will be addressed in the next release - [Federated Access Manager 8.0](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/federated_access_manager_roadmap) - and is already in [OpenSSO](http://opensso.dev.java.net/). So, if your existing infrastructure leans to the MS side, but you need world-class web access management, federation, identity web services and more, scoot on over to [OpenSSO](http://opensso.dev.java.net/) and take a look.
