A personal highlight of my first trip to [JavaPolis](http://www.javapolis.com/) last week was meeting Java product marketing goddess [Jean Elliott](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanelliott). Here we are backstage (rock and roll!) along with [some old geezer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling) that wandered into shot :-)

Thanks for the pic, Jacki! [More of Jacki's JavaPolis pics](http://www.flickr.com/photos/98227161@N00/sets/72157603487645153/).
