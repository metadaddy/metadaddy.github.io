The play '[Final Solutions](http://www.naatak.com/current_event.htm)' ([trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgQmNOkQUJU), [pictures](http://podila.com/events/2008/Naatak-FinalSolutions-Preview), [more pictures](http://sbasumal.smugmug.com/gallery/6230080_3bjFD)), centers on Hindu-Muslim conflict in India, from partition to the current day. The play is presented by [Naatak](http://www.naatak.com/), a group of Indian theater enthusiasts here in the San Francisco Bay Area. The [curtain raiser article in Indian Express](http://www.naatak.com/Final%20Solutions/IndianExpressNaatakFinalsolutionsCurtainRaiser.pdf) gives much more background.

"OK - that's very interesting, Pat, but what has it got to do with [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/), identity, or anything I come here to read?" Well, OpenSSO development manager Ajay Sondhi appears in the play - in fact, you can just catch a glimpse of him at 0:29 in the [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgQmNOkQUJU); Ajay is on the far left, with the yellow mask. If Ajay is involved, it's clearly going to be good, so hop along to the Cubberley Theatre in Palo Alto - the last performance is this Friday, October 17th. Oh yeah, Ajay's daughter, Kriti, has a lead role, but I don't think she's even filed a bug on OpenSSO, let alone committed code, so we're wandering a little _too_ far off topic with that information ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/wink.gif)
