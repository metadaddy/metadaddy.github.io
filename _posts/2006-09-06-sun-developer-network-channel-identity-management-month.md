[Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/)'s [SDN Channel](http://blogs.sun.com/SDNChannel/) this month focuses on Identity Management. There's a [cool video](http://blogs.sun.com/SDNChannel/entry/build_identity_confidence) featuring my esteemed colleague - Identity Guru [Aravindan Ranganathan](http://blogs.sun.com/aravind). Aravindan looks at some of the latest web services security features in [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml) 7.1, bringing a new twist to that old staple web service sample - the stock ticker - by allowing only authenticated users to obtain real-time quotes. If you want to try this at home, the beta of Access Manager 7.1 is available **_now_** in the [Java EE SDK download](http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/index.jsp).

There's a whole load more useful information (and a link to a short article I wrote on [open source identity at Sun](http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/identserver/reference/techart/identity.html)) in the [SDN Show Notes](http://blogs.sun.com/SDNChannel/entry/welcome_to_the_new_sdn).
