Across the wires this morning comes news from [Kim](http://www.identityblog.com/?p=934) and [Stefan](http://idcorner.org/2008/03/06/microsoft-acquires-credenticas-u-prove-technology/) that Microsoft has acquired [Credentica](http://www.credentica.com/)'s [U-Prove technology](http://www.credentica.com/technology.html) and the services of Stefan and his Credentica colleagues. I'm curious as to why the news isn't simply 'Microsoft acquires Credentica', but business is sometimes like that, I guess.

Anyway, congratulations to Stefan and co! I've been following their technology for a few years now (I even worked my way through [Stefan's book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262024918/superpatterns-20) - well, most of it - some of the formal proofs were a little beyond my mathematical abilities) and have met Stefan and Greg a couple of times - super guys, cool technology - it will be great to see it get wider exposure.
