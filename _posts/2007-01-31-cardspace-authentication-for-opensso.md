Quite excited to return from vacation today and find an email in my inbox from [Martin Gee](http://www.icsynergy.com/martin/) of [ICSynergy](http://www.icsynergy.com/) (a Sun-partner system integrator specializing in identity management) pointing me to his blog entry on [adding CardSpace authentication to OpenSSO](http://icsynergy.com/martin/2007/01/cardspace_authentication_for_o.html). Martin does a great job of explaining his use case, linking a personal card to an existing account in [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/), screenshots and all.

This is fantastic stuff - a great foundation for OpenSSO/CardSpace integration. I'm certainly looking forward to seeing the code made available. And, of course, it will work just as well with [Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/), OpenSSO's almost-twin.
