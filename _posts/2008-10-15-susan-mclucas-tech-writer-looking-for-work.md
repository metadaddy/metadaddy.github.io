Since I encouraged Susan to create a blog, and she actually went ahead and did it, I'm happy to be able to link to her... [Susan McLucas](http://susanmclucas.blogspot.com/) is a [tech writer looking for work](http://susanmclucas.blogspot.com/2008/10/keeping-it-simple-i-am-writer-for-hire.html). She has worked for companies ranging from startups to giants like Intel and Cisco - in fact, [Cisco acquired the last startup she worked for](http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2007/corp_061107.html), so she has experience of the acquisition process too.

As I mentioned in my recommendation on her [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/1/96a/888):

> I know Susan socially, rather than through her work, but I can attest that she is articulate and professional with a keen eye for detail. If we had any openings in my group here at Sun, I'd definitely hire her.

So, there you go, if you're looking for a tech writer, contact Susan through her [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/1/96a/888) or [leave a comment on her blog](http://susanmclucas.blogspot.com/2008/10/keeping-it-simple-i-am-writer-for-hire.html#comments). And tell her I sent you ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)
