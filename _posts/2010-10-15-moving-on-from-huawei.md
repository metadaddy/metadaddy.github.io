After just over a year at [Huawei](http://www.huawei.com/), it's time to move on... Later today I'll be handing back my Huawei laptop and badge; on Monday I'll be attending orientation at [Salesforce.com](http://salesforce.com/), where I'll be joining the [developer evangelism team](http://developer.force.com/).

It's been an interesting and productive year at Huawei - if you've been following my blog, you'll know that I've been doing some pretty low level stuff - [Linux kernel drivers](a-simple-block-driver-for-linux-kernel-2-6-31) and server daemons, and I've learned lots about [zero-copy](zero-copy-in-linux-with-sendfile-and-splice) technology and [semaphores](semaphores-on-linux-sem_init-vs-sem_open). All fascinating stuff, working with [great](http://www.cryptoclarity.com/James_P_Hughes/James_P_Hughes.html) [people](http://www.spcoast.com/wiki/index.php/John_Plocher) and [visiting some cool places](a-weekend-in-xian), but, still, I missed the interaction with a developer community that I enjoyed as Sun's 'OpenSSO Community Guy'.

As is [traditional](leaving-here), I've trawled YouTube for an appropriate song to mark the occasion. I almost settled for Led Zep's [Babe I'm Gonna Leave You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFIORuvNa9I), but stumbled across the [Quivver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quivver) remix of the same song - a very different take on the classic, and well worth a listen. If you like what you hear, you can pick it up on [Perfecto Presents Another World](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004WGVW?ie=UTF8&tag=superpatterns-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00004WGVW)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=superpatterns-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00004WGVW).
