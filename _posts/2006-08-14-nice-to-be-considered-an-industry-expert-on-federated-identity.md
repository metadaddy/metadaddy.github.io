[...even if it's qualified by 'so-called' and my cluefulness is called into question](http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2006/08/federated-identity-and-industry.html) :-)

[James McGovern](http://duckdown.blogspot.com/) asks

> when was the last time he [Pat Patterson of Sun] asked members of Project Liberty to start sharing pain points outside of the Project Liberty forum for others to consume and learn from?

Well - that's precisely what many members of Project Liberty recently did in the recent [Identity Open Space in Vancouver](http://ios.windley.com/wiki/IOSVan). As its name suggests, this event was open to all-comers and jointly produced by the [Liberty Alliance Project](http://projectliberty.org) and some of the leading participants in the [Internet Identity Workshop](http://iiw.windley.com/wiki/Workshop2006). We had some fascinating discussions, [mostly documented (to greater or lesser extent) in the wiki](http://ios.windley.com/wiki/Sessions).

Another interesting aspect of this event was that ([as I blogged previously](http://blog.superpat.com/2006/06/02/identity-open-space-vancouver-july-20-21/)) IOS attendees were able to also attend Liberty's plenary sessions (under NDA), observing and even contributing to the discussion. My understanding (and no warranty, express or implied, is attached to this statement) is that the Liberty folks were very happy with the way this all turned out and keen to repeat it regularly in the future.

In the meantime, there will be another [IOS next month in Santa Clara](http://ios.windley.com/wiki/IOSSantaClara). Although this IOS is in association with the [Digital ID World Conference](http://conference.digitalidworld.com/2006/), I wouldn't be surprised to see many of the Liberty folks there.

See you there, James?
