Where does that line come from? I just tried <del>googling</del> using the Google search engine to search for it, and all I get is usage, no citation...

Anyway - the point of this post is that we have 'thrown the switch' on OpenSSO - we are turning on write access to the source tree. Here is the text of the [official announcement](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=4039):

> Welcome to the official launch of the OpenSSO project and community site. OpenSSO is an open source access management software distribution that provides the means to build authentication, authorization, and session management for Java and web applications and web services. OpenSSO is the result of a close collaboration between a community of developers and Sun engineers working to promote the evaluation, use, and innovation of identity and access management technology. And, since Sun will be basing the Sun Java System Access Manager product on OpenSSO, eventually everything that is committed to the OpenSSO source will end up running in real, production deployments.
> 
> So what happened today? In simple terms, we are finally turning on full read and write access to the source code. What does that mean for you, the developer?
> 
> Through the OpenSSO project site, we invite you to participate in the development process by reviewing source code, providing input on features, submitting bug fixes, requesting new functionality, and spearheading other improvements. You can check out source. You can download and deploy the J2EE web application archive. You can break it, fix it, write about it, and talk about it. Or, simply join in the technical discussions.
> 
> We thank you for participating.

Right now we are assembling the initial list of committers - mostly the Sun engineers that built Access Manager and OpenSSO, but also likely some external folks with a history of working Access Manager at a low level.

If you'd like to get more deeply involved with OpenSSO, perhaps even to the extent of submitting code and then even becoming a committer, check out the [governance](https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/about/governance/index.html).
