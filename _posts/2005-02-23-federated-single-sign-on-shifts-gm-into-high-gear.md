eWeek is featuring a great [article](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1768255,00.asp) covering General Motors' 'MySocrates' employee portal and its pilot Liberty implementation. GM are using [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml) as their Liberty identity provider, deploying federated single sign-on to 70,000 of its US-based employees. The pilot implementation provided SSO to GM's 401(k) provider; GM is now looking at enabling further services using Liberty.  
A very telling quote: "While [GM's director of software technology, John] Jackson estimated the technology should take no longer than two months to deploy, he said legal and business issues may cause the project to take as much as one year to complete."
