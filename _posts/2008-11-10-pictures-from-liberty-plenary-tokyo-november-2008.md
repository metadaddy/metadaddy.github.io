I took a bunch of pictures around Tokyo last week - [here's the set at Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/superpat/sets/72157608688952630/). Many thanks to Colin Wallis and Fulup Ar Foll for being the official photographers at the Liberty Allstars vs NTT [futsal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futsal) match :-)
