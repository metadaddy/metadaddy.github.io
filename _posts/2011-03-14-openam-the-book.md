[![OpenAM](http://blog.superpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/0226os_mockupcover_ex.jpg.png "OpenAM"){: .align-left}](http://link.packtpub.com/7M2hsY)Regular readers will know that I moved on from my role as community lead for [OpenSSO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSO) some time ago, first [to Huawei](http://blog.superpat.com/2009/09/21/im-now-at-huawei/), then, a few months ago, [to salesforce.com](http://blog.superpat.com/2010/11/01/salesforce-com-%e2%80%93-two-weeks-in/), blogging mostly at [the Force.com blog](http://blog.sforce.com/). In that time, [Forgerock](http://www.forgerock.com/) have adopted OpenSSO, rechristening it [OpenAM](http://www.forgerock.com/openam.html), and [my ex-colleague Indira Thangasamy](http://indirat.wordpress.com/), Senior Quality Engineering Manager for OpenSSO, has been hard at work on [his book on OpenAM](http://link.packtpub.com/7M2hsY). [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/) were kind enough to send me a review copy of OpenAM, and a very professional job it is. While I've not had a chance to read it in detail, what I have read so far has been excellent - Indira writes clearly, covering every aspect of OpenAM, from the basics of single sign-on to advanced topics such as integrating OpenAM with Google Apps and salesforce.com (yay!) and interacting with OpenAM via its RESTful identity web service interface. I'll post a more thorough review once I'm done reading, suffice to say for now, if you're working with or evaluating OpenSSO/OpenAM, this should definitely be on your bookshelf!
