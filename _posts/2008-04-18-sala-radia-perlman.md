Had to get a shot of this - [Radia](http://research.sun.com/people/mybio.php?uid=28941) was my [SEED](http://research.sun.com/spotlight/2004-02-18.SEED.html) mentor [a little while ago](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/chatting_with_radia) - now she's been commemorated in the naming of the press room here at [FISL](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/9.0/www/). Kind of appropriate for a [pioneer in communications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radia_Perlman) ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)
