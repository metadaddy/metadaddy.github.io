Over the past few days, the number of participants registered at [opensso.dev.java.net](http://opensso.dev.java.net/) passed the 700 mark. It was almost exactly a year ago that [we passed 400](http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/400_project_members_at_opensso), so we're currently adding new members at the rate of nearly one a day!

<a name="AquariumJumpIn">Just to clarify, you can</a> [download the OpenSSO binaries](https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/use/index.html) and [check out the source code](https://opensso.dev.java.net/source/browse/opensso/) without any kind of sign-up whatsoever. You only need to register to [file issues](https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/about/faqcenter/faqbugs.html), [subscribe to the mailing lists](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList) and start [submitting patches](https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/about/faqcenter/faqgetstart.html#patch).

It's not always obvious how the java.net account and [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) membership are related, so here's a quick 3-step guide to getting onto the OpenSSO mailing lists:

1\. [Register for a java.net account](https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/Join).  
2\. [Request 'Observer' role on OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest).  
3\. [Subscribe to 'users@opensso.dev.java.net' and/or 'dev@opensso.dev.java.net'](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList).

Both of these mailing lists are moderated - subscribers' emails go straight to the list, but emails from non-subscribers go into a moderation queue. If you are posting to the OpenSSO lists and wondering why your email hasn't appeared yet, ensure you are using the email account you registered in step 1!
