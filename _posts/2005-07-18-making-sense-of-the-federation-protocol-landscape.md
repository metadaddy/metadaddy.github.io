By way of [Archie Reed's Secure Identity Management Blog](http://www.hp.com/blogs/reed/) (Archie is a Director in Identity Management at HP), I just came across this article on Federation by Jason Rouault (also at HP) - [Making sense of the federation protocol landscape](http://devresource.hp.com/drc/resources/fed_land/index.jsp).  
While, obviously, I would direct you away from the section on HP products at the end (![](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/images/smileys/smile.gif)), the remainder is a nice summary of federation and a useful comparison of the various protocols.
