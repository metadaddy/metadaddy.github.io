I guess a [bunch](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan?entry=niagara_free_trial_update) of [people](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/dlacher?entry=kick_the_tire_and_light) have [blogged](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/mary?entry=more_free_stuff) about [this](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/arhus?entry=sun_is_giving_a_server) - I'm piling on since I know a couple of friends who read this will be interested. Anyway - we're running a [free trial of the T2000](http://www.sun.com/emrkt/trycoolthreads/index.html?cid=109687) right now. Basically, you sign up online to try out a T2000 server, and, if you qualify, Sun pay the shipping (hopefully one way, since you're like this baby so much you won't want to part with it, but potentially two ways if you're out of your mind ![](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/images/smileys/smile.gif)) and you get 60 days of [Cool Thread](http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/overview/index.jsp) fun.

[![Test-drive the New Sun Fire T2000 Server](http://www.sun.com/images/l0/l0_niagara_sign-up.jpg)](http://www.sun.com/emrkt/trycoolthreads/index.html?cid=109687)

So, snag a box, throw your worst multi-threaded torture test at it and see how it does. No charge. And, if you come up with a particularly neat app that really uses the T2000 to its utmost, you can [win $50,000 in cash _and_ a T2000 to keep](https://coolthreads.dev.java.net/).
