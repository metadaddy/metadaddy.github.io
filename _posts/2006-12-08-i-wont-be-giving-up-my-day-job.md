...to move into either videography or singing. From the un-talent show at [IIW 2006b](http://iiw.windley.com/wiki/Workshop2006b):

[Here's the video I shot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b5EcU2dH5E) for [Conor](http://conorcahill.blogspot.com/) showing miscellaneous [IIWers](http://iiw.windley.com/wiki/Workshop2006b#Who_is_Coming) singing '[Bohemian Identity](http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/archives/2006/12/05/bohemian-rhapsody-in-the-key-of-id/)'. [Bruce Gowers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Gowers) it ain't.

And here are [John Kemp](http://appliedlife.blogspot.com/) and I [butchering Led Zep's 'Whole Lotta Love'](http://www.flickr.com/photos/xmlgrrl/317389943/). No sound recording, as far as I know, thank goodness... Thanks to [Eve](http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog) for the photo - [read her report on the evening here](http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/archives/2006/12/08/cant-do-this-to-me-baby/).
