From [Indira](http://blogs.sun.com/indira/), news of three openings in the [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) QA team:

*   [Entry Level QA Engineer](http://www.sun.com/corp_emp/search.cgi?req=560547) (0-2 years experience)
*   [Entry Level QA Engineer](http://www.sun.com/corp_emp/search.cgi?req=560548) (0-2 years experience)
*   [QA Engineer - Automation Architect](http://www.sun.com/corp_emp/search.cgi?req=560888) (6+ years experience)

Don't imagine that 'QA' here means 'click around the UI and see if the system responds according to spec, or at least, doesn't surprise you too much'... Take a look at the job specs behind those links. You'll actually be developing the test system for OpenSSO - working with technologies from [Python](http://www.python.org/)/[Jython](http://www.jython.org/) to [LDAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) to [Java EE](http://java.sun.com/javaee/), across [seven operating systems and server products from at least as many vendors](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/Support+Dashboard). Not only that, this is an open source project, so part of your work will be to hang out on the [OpenSSO mailing lists](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList) and [IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensso), and even blog about it all. Yep - get paid for IRC and blogging.

So - if you are <span class="snap_nopreview">[smart and gets things done](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590598385/superpatterns-20)</span>, click on those links, and if you like what you see, apply, and tell them I sent you (we have a referral program) ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)

**!!!STOP PRESS!!!** More OpenSSO openings:

*   [Entry Level Engineer](http://www.sun.com/corp_emp/search.cgi?req=560544) (0-2 years experience)

*   [Entry Level Engineer](http://www.sun.com/corp_emp/search.cgi?req=560549) (0-2 years experience)
*   [Entry/Intermediate Level Engineer](http://www.sun.com/corp_emp/search.cgi?req=560564) (0-5 years experience)

Plenty of positions there if you'd rather be the one being tortured (product engineering) than the torturer (QA) ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)
