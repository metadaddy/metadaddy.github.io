Well, this is my first try at '[audioblogging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audioblogging)'. [Here is an MP3](http://mediacast.sun.com/share/superpat/GSN-1785.mp3) (just over 70 minutes) of the audio track from last October's Federation/SSO webinar. Listen at your leisure. There is also a PDF of the slides [here](http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/javatools/jsenterprise/reference/presentations/sso_presentation.pdf).  
Let me know if you make it through to the bitter end...
