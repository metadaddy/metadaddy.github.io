[Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) and I just published an article over on the [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/) (SDN) - [Switch on SAML for PHP with Project Lightbulb](http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/identserver/reference/techart/lightbulb.html). The article walks through some of the [Project Lightbulb](https://lightbulb.dev.java.net/) code, following the single sign-on process. If you want to work with the Lightbulb code, or you just want a better idea of how [SAML 2.0](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security#samlv20) works, this article is for you.

As I mention in the conclusion, we'll look at SAML 2.0 single logout and the circle-of-trust in a future article.
