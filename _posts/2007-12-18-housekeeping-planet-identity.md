It's time to do a little housekeeping over at [Planet Identity](http://planetidentity.org/). First, the easy stuff... The feeds for Dmitry Shechtman ([feed](http://blog.phpbb.cc/feed/)) and Trusted Network Technologies ([feed](http://knowidentity.typepad.com/tnt/index.rdf)) have been returning 404 since I-don't-know-when, so I've deleted them from the subscription list. If you know the current whereabouts of Dmitry's or TNT's blogs, then please [leave a comment](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/housekeeping_planet_identity#comments), or email me (if you're reading this in your RSS reader, then just click through to [Planet Identity](http://planetidentity.org/) or [Superpatterns](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/) - my email address is in the sidebar on both.)

Now, the hard stuff. [Shelley Powers](http://burningbird.net/) ([feed](http://burningbird.net/feed/)) and [Doc Searls](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc) ([feed](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/feed/)) both write entertaining, lucid, insightful prose, but most of it is not about identity. I've resisted removing folks from the subscription list for some time, but I had some really good feedback at the recent [IIW](http://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php/Iiw2007b) on the usefulness of Planet Identity and how it would benefit from more focus. So, if you want to carry on reading Shelley and Doc, do what I just did - subscribe to them directly - those feed URLs again - [Shelley](http://burningbird.net/feed/), [Doc](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/feed/).

Much as I enjoy playing (more or less) [benevolent dictator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator) (mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!), Planet Identity is there for you, the readers. If you have an opinion, either way, on any of these changes, then please [leave me a comment](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/housekeeping_planet_identity#comments). If you'd rather express your opinion to me privately, then, again, my email address is on the sidebar at both [Planet Identity](http://planetidentity.org/) and [Superpatterns](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/).

With that, I'll bid you a good day and leave you to the ever-widening river of news...
