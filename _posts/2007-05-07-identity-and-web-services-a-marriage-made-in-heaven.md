Although I don't have a technical session this year, I will be up at [JavaOne](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/) tomorrow, presenting "Identity and Web Services: A Marriage Made in Heaven?" with my good friend, [the Wizard of IdM, Don Bowen](http://blogs.sun.com/wizidm/), at 1:05pm in the [Pavilion Theater](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/activities.jsp#theater). We'll spend about 20 minutes exploring the different ways that identity and web services impact each other. If you've heard Don on the [Sun IdM podcasts](http://www.sun.com/software/products/identity/podcasts.jsp), you know this'll be fun ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)

_UPDATE_ - [here are the slides [PDF]](http://blog.superpat.com/IdentityWebServicesJ107.pdf).
