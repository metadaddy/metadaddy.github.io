[As I just mentioned](http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/sdn_interview_with_sun_technical) over at [The Aquarium](http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/), [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) recently published a short [interview with Paul Bryan](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/openid.html), in which Paul talks about [OpenID](http://openid.net/), [OpenSSO](http://www.opensso.org/) and the fight against phishing and identity theft.

OpenSSO participants and regular readers will recognize Paul's name - he was the very first external committer on the OpenSSO project, back in 2006\. Paul went on to write the [OpenID Extension for OpenSSO](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/new_drop_of_the_opensso) ([since deployed at openid.sun.com](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/openid_at_sun)) before joining Sun in October 2007\. While we were sad to 'lose' an external committer, we were very happy to welcome Paul to Sun.
