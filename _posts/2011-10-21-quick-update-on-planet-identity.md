[Planet Identity](http://planetidentity.org/) (PId) mostly runs itself, thanks to [Sam Ruby](http://intertwingly.net/blog/)'s excellent [Planet Venus](http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/); usually, the only maintenance required is to add new subscriptions as folks submit interesting feeds. Very rarely I remove a feed from PId, usually because it's dead, but occasionally because the feed content doesn't quite 'fit' PId. Over the past few days a couple of people mentioned that [Dave Kearns](https://twitter.com/#%21/dak3)' [IdM Journal](http://idmjournal.com/), while a fine selection of links to relevant content, seems out of place amongst the 'primary source' articles at Planet Identity. I agreed, and, Dave having no objection, I've removed IdM Journal from PId. If you want to continue receiving IdM Journal, just point your feed reader at [http://feeds2.feedburner.com/idmjournal/LhRB](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/idmjournal/LhRB). Do feel free to leave any suggestions for PId in the comments here, and have a good weekend, identity folk!
