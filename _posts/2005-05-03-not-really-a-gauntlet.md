[Eric Norlin](http://ericnorlin.typepad.com/weblog/) at [PingID](http://www.pingidentity.com/) [commented](http://ericnorlin.typepad.com/weblog/2005/04/beat_that_ping.html) on my response to [PingID's recent press release](http://www.pingidentity.com/news/showPressRelease.action?id=51) on federation-enabling Windows logon. I wasn't really throwing down the gauntlet, more pointing out the - shall we say - exaggeration that (quoting from the press release)

> This makes it possible, for the first time, to provide seamless single sign-on access to remote resources and applications across autonomous security domains and corporate boundaries - from the Windows desktop logon via SAML.

I am a nice guy, really, Eric. If you're going to be at Digital ID World next week then do stop by the Sun stand and say "Hi!" - that goes for anyone reading this. I'll be there every day - if you want to chat and I'm not on the stand when you're passing, then ask one of the other Sun folks when I'll be around.
