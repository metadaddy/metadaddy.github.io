I co-presented two sessions at JavaOne in San Francisco in June. I'm honoured to be invited to repeat them at JavaOne Tokyo next month. Here are the details:

<th>Session Abstract:</th>

<td>The [Liberty Alliance Project](http://www.projectliberty.org/) (LAP) defines specifications to address cross business web single sign-on (ID-FF) and provides a framework for building web services (ID-WSF). These specifications are by far the most comprehensive security framework available today to build secure identity-enabled web services. ID-WSF addresses the need to build interoperable, identity-based, identity-consuming, and standard web services.This session focuses on developing client- and server-side components of a secure identity web service based on Liberty ID-WSF specifications and deploying them in a Liberty-enabled environment. This session covers several Java™ standard technologies: Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE™ platform), XML parsing, JAX-RPC, XML digital signing and encryption, and others, such as Liberty Java APIs built on top of SAML and WS-Security.</td>

<th>Session Abstract:</th>

<td>Single sign-on between an enterprise’s web-based resources, such as applications based on Java™ 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE™ platform) and .NET, has existed in proprietary form for some time. The need to allow access across enterprise boundaries prompted the development of standards, such as SAML and Liberty ID-FF for identity federation, providing capabilities such as single sign-on and account linking across enterprise boundaries.This session provides a brief overview of the standards for identity federation, shows how to integrate SAML and Liberty ID-FF with J2EE platform Security, and explains how Java technology-based access management products, such as [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml), can provide interfaces even into a .NET infrastructure such as Active Directory.</td>

So - come along and find out the latest about getting your J2EE infrastructure interoperating with AD and .NET, and implementing ID-WSF web service providers and consumers in Java.</div>
