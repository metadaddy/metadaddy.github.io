For whatever reason, [James](http://duckdown.blogspot.com/) hasn't moderated-in my comment on his [Random Thoughts for 2009-01-18](http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2009/01/random-thoughts-for-2009-01-18.html), so here it is in blog entry form...

For some reason, James has a [bee in his bonnet](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59775.html) over [referential integrity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity) and LDAP. I'm really not sure where he's coming from here - both [OpenDS](http://opends.org/) and [OpenLDAP](http://openldap.org/) offer referential integrity ([OpenDS ref int doc](https://www.opends.org/wiki/page/MaintainingReferentialIntegrity), [OpenLDAP ref int doc](http://www.symas.com/refint.shtml)), and [Sun Directory Server](http://www.sun.com/software/products/directory_srvr_ee/dir_srvr/index.xml) has offered it for _years_ ([Sun Directory Server ref int doc](http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-2763/fsush?a=view)). Does this answer your question, James, or am I missing something?

By the way, if you're wondering about the title of this post, it's an allusion to the mighty [Half Man Half Biscuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_Man_Half_Biscuit)'s 1986 track [Architecture and Morality, Ted & Alice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOtO5ArQNj8), which itself was a play on the titles of [Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestral_Manoeuvres_in_the_Dark)'s 1981 album [Architecture & Morality](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008NF6J/superpatterns-20) and the 1969 movie [Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice]( http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00030GPWE/superpatterns-20). If there was any justice in the world, there'd be a neat link back to the world of identity here, but there isn't, so there's not...
