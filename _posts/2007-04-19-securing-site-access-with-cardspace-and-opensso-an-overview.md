As you may recall from [a previous blog entry](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/cardspace_authentication_for_opensso), a little while ago, [Martin Gee](http://icsynergy.com/martin/) of [ICSynergy](http://icsynergy.com/) (one of Sun's system integrator partners, focussing on identity management, federation and SOA) [blogged about some work he'd done integrating OpenSSO with CardSpace](http://icsynergy.com/martin/2007/01/cardspace_authentication_for_o.html). He's since [written this up as an article](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/cardspace.html) for [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/). It's a great overview of both [CardSpace](http://cardspace.netfx3.com/) and the mechanics of extending [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/) to support new authentication mechanisms.

It's good to see folks innovating on OpenSSO, and it's _great_ to see them documenting their work like this.
