Well, I've been beavering away on the [design for WS-Federation support in OpenSSO [PDF]](https://opensso.dev.java.net/files/documents/3676/52056/WSFedSDD01.pdf). I just uploaded it to the [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/) project site and [sent it to the dev@opensso mailing list](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=220). It's a first draft, so there are places that need some more detail and clarity, but I think it's ready for a first review. If you do have any feedback, then please [sign up to the OpenSSO project](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest) and submit your comments via the dev mailing list.
