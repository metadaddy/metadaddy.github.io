I have a packed schedule this fall - well, packed for me, anyway:

First up, next week, is [Digital ID World](http://conference.digitalidworld.com/2007/) at the [Hilton in San Francisco](http://www.sanfranciscohiltonhotel.com/). I'll be there for [Sun's reception on Monday evening](http://blogs.sun.com/idmbuzz/entry/digital_id_world) and the [Concordia workshop on Wednesday](http://projectconcordia.org/index.php/Main_Page#Meeting_Schedule). The [last Concordia workshop](http://projectconcordia.org/index.php/Catalyst_Concordia_Workshop_June_26%2C_2007_Theme_Summary), colocated with [Burton Catalyst](http://catalyst.burtongroup.com/NA07/index.html), back in June, gave some great insights into some real-world identity interoperability, with [George Fletcher of AOL [PDF]](http://projectconcordia.org/images/c/c7/AOLConcordiaWorkshop06.26.07.pdf), [Mike Beach of Boeing [PDF]](http://projectconcordia.org/images/c/c8/BoeingConcordiaWorkshop06.26.07.pdf), [Jim Heaton of GM [PDF]](http://projectconcordia.org/images/c/cd/GMShortConcordiaWorkshop06.26.07.pdf), [Ian Bailey of the BC Government [PDF]](http://projectconcordia.org/images/d/dc/GovtofBritishColumbiaConcordiaWorkshop06.26.07.pdf) and [Georgia Marsh of GSA [PDF]](http://projectconcordia.org/images/4/4a/USGSAConcordiaWorkshop06.26.07.pdf) explaining the interop issues they are facing, as well as some notable successes. This time round, representatives of Chevron, InCommon and the State Services Commission of the New Zealand Government will be presenting. Admission is free - just [add yourself to the wiki](http://projectconcordia.org/index.php/DIDW_Workshop_participation_list).

Next month, from October 23rd to 25th, is the [Liberty Alliance](http://www.projectliberty.org/) plenary meeting in Tokyo. The plenary meeting is Liberty members-only, but there is an open [workshop day](http://www.convention-info.net/lad2007/index.html) on the Friday. [On the packed bill](http://www.convention-info.net/lad2007/program.html) are [Roger Sullivan](http://rogerksullivan.blogspot.com/) of Oracle, Makoto Hatakeyama of NEC, [Paul Madsen](http://connectid.blogspot.com/) of NTT, [Prateek Mishra](http://blogs.oracle.com/identityprivacy/) of Oracle, Yukio Itakura of the [Institute of Information Security](http://www.iisec.ac.jp/), Colin Wallis of the [New Zealand State Services Commission](http://www.ssc.govt.nz/), Ken Ojiri of NTT, [Brett McDowell](http://brettmcdowell.com/blog) of the Liberty Alliance, Kenji Takahashi of NTT and my good self. I will be presenting an update on open source identity at Sun - [OpenSSO](http://opensso.dev.java.net/), [OpenDS](http://www.opends.org/) and... well, you'll have to wait and see. The event is free - just [register here](http://convention-info.net/lad2007/regist.htm).

November brings my first ever trip to Raleigh, North Carolina, on November 8th, to talk to the [Triangle Linux Users Group](http://www.trilug.org/). They've given me 2 hours (the fools!) to wax lyrical on identity from LDAP to SAML and beyond. Attendance is free and open, so, if you're in the Triangle area, come along. It starts at 7pm and, apparently, there is pizza.

Finally, in December, the good folks at [Javapolis](http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/Home) in Antwerp have kindly invited me to present 3 sessions - one each on [SAML 2.0](http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/SAML+v2), [Liberty ID-WSF 2.0](http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/Liberty+Alliance+ID-WSF+2.0) and [OpenSSO](http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/OpenSSO). Hmm - I must submit those abstracts... I'm afraid you have to pay this time, but, at 410 Euros for the entire week (December 10th - 14th), it's great value. [Here's the registration page](http://www.javapolis.com/jp07reg/registration/start.htm).

So - there you have it - come along to one of the events, say hi, eat pizza and find out about identity, federation and OpenSSO ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)
