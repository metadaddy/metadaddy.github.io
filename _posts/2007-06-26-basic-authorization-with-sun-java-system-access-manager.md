As I [reported yesterday at The Aquarium](http://blogs.sun.com/page/theaquarium?anchor=new_opensso_articles_at_sun), Robert Skoczylas of [Indigo Consulting](http://www.indigoconsulting.com/) and Sun tech author [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) just published [Developing Secure Applications with Sun Java System Access Manager, Part 1: Basic Authorization](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/secureapps.html) at [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/). This article, part 1 of a series, presents a case study of implementing authentication, single sign-on, and authorization at a fictional health-care insurance company.

There's some really good stuff in there - Robert and Marina work from a high-level description of the problem right down to specific Access Manager customizations. In particular, the detailed description of customizing [Access Manager's policy framework](http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-4669/6n6q9stbs?a=view) is well worth the read for anyone working with, or evaluating, [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/).
