[A couple of weeks ago, I posted](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/sun_folks_sign_up_to) on the challenge that [James Governor](http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/) of [Redmonk](http://www.redmonk.com/) (aka '[Monkchips](http://twitter.com/monkchips)') set - ["who is coolest from a Dopplr perspective- IBM or Sun?"](http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/2007/10/18/now-its-a-game-an-ibm-vs-sun-game-dopplr-meets-cagefightr/). The idea was to see who could add the most [Dopplr](http://www.dopplr.com/) members over the next week - Sun or IBM. IBM, of course, have 10x the headcount that Sun have, but surely, surely, Sun are at least 10x cooler, from a Dopplr, or any other perspective...?

Well, the numbers are out, and the answer is... Sun! Of course! ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif) [It was a close run thing](http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/2007/10/30/sun-wins-the-dopplr-2-by-a-nose/), but we pulled it off. Now to celebrate by going and adding another trip to [my Dopplr profile](http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/metadaddy) - [IIW 2007b](http://www.windley.com/events/iiw2007b/announcement) in Mountain View, CA, December 3-5 2007\.
