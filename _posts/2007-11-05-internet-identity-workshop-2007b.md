As if I didn't have [enough on my plate for the next few weeks](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/all_new_fall_schedule), I'll be schlepping up [101](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_101_in_California#San_Francisco_Bay_Area) to the [Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/) in Mountain View from December 3rd-5th for [Internet Identity Workshop 2007b](http://www.windley.com/events/iiw2007b/).

I'll be catching up with old friends, hoping to hear more about [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) and [OpenSocial](http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/), and maybe even contributing to the untalent show on the Tuesday night. See you there!
