Looks like [Hu](http://www.ssocircle.com/about.shtml)'s been busy - not only has he deployed a [sample SAML 2.0 service provider](http://lightbulb.saml2.com/lb/home.php) based on the SAML 2.0/PHP [OpenSSO Extension](https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/extensions/) (formerly known as Lightbulb), he's also rolled out [Paul's OpenID code](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/openid_on_opensso) (another OpenSSO Extension). So, now you can go [register at SSOCircle](http://idp.ssocircle.com/sso/UI/Login) and use either SAML 2.0 or OpenID to authenticate to relying parties/service providers, all through the magic of [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/). Cool!
