I just pulled the trigger on the first draft OpenSSO WS-Federation Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - [see it on the dev-AT-opensso.dev.java.net mailing list here](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=129). This is the first requirements document to be completed under the new OpenSSO development process. I have to admit, it feels pretty strange having this out there in the open!

As I mention in the email, comments are welcome, so, please, [sign up to the OpenSSO project](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest) and submit your feedback via the dev mailing list.
