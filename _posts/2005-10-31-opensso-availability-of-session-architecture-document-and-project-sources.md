The second OpenSSO roadmap milestone has been reached on schedule.

Briefly, the architecture document and associated source code for the 'Session' module is now available at [https://opensso.dev.java.net/](https://opensso.dev.java.net/). For more details, see the [announcement](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=2905).

Some 'exclusive' information:

*   The project sources contain about 565 source files out of which 550 are the core system and the rest are for demo purposes.
*   All this compiles in under a minute :) and can be compiled on any platform.
*   The demo works on all platforms and does not require any ldap. It uses the flat file database and is fairly easy to get up and running quickly.

Congratulations to Arvind and the rest of the OpenSSO team!
