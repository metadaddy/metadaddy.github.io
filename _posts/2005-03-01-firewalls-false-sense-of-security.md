[Opinion piece in Computerworld](http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,100021,00.html) by Jerrold M. Grochow, vice president for information services and technology at MIT, on the limitations of perimeter security and the importance of authorization - closing quote:

> Firewalls can go only so far -- at some point, you'll have to develop a secure identity structure that's incorporated into each and every application. And projects such as Kerberos, Shibboleth and Liberty will lead the way.

I would add SAML to that list, and note that SAML 2.0 incorporates functionality from both Liberty ID-FF and Shibboleth.
