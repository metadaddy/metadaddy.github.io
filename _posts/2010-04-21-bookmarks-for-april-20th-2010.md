These are my links for April 20th 2010:

*   [Alternative Type Finder](http://julianhansen.com/index.php?/alternative-type-finder/) - Cool flowchart to choose just the right typeface for your project
*   [Jackson JSON Processor](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) - Looks like a useful library for handling JSON from Java
