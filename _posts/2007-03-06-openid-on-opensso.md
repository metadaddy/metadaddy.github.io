Paul Bryan, one of our 'external' [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/) committers, has been hard at work implementing an [OpenID](http://openid.net/) identity provider for OpenSSO. You can take a look at his work so far at [openid.pbryan.com](http://openid.pbryan.com/) - by the time you read this, there might even be some test accounts available there to play with. I spent a happy half hour last night logging into [Jyte](http://jyte.com/), [FirstSSO](http://firstsso.netmesh.org/), [OpenID Wiki](http://openid.net/wiki) and more.

Watch for the source appearing at [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/) any day now...
