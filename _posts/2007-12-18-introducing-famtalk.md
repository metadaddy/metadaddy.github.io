As [Terry Sigle](http://blogs.sun.com/tls/) [blogs today](http://blogs.sun.com/tls/entry/famtalk_talking_about_federated_access), [FAMTalk](http://famtalk.org/) ([feed](http://www.famtalk.org/rss.xml)) went live this week. FAMTalk is a monthly podcast focusing on federation and access management (the FAM of the title) and their implementation in Sun Java System Federated Access Manager (the forthcoming next version of [Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/)) and [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/). Your regular hosts will be Tim Campbell (Sun Partner Enablement), Steven Jarosz (Sun Americas Software SE - Federal), Terry (Sun Americas Software SE - Telco) and me (OpenSSO 'community guy').

In episodes 1a and 1b (we split the original 1hr 40mins or so in two), Tim presents Access Manager 101\. You can download a PDF plus MP3 or AAC files from [FAMTalk.org](http://famtalk.org/), or simply [subscribe to FAMTalk via iTunes](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=270422627) or [RSS](http://www.famtalk.org/rss.xml). Apparently the AAC files include the slides, which should play in sync with the audio on many iPods. I need to go check it out on my iPhone and see how it looks...
