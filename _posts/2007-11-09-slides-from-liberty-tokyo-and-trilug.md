I've been back from Tokyo for a couple of weeks now and just realized that I haven't posted slides from my presentation on [OpenSSO](http://opensso.dev.java.net/), so [here they are [PDF]](http://blog.superpat.com/images/OpenSSO_LibertyTokyo2007.pdf). Many thanks to the [Liberty Alliance Japan SIG](http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/public_community/japan_sig) for organizing this day - about 220 attendees heard the latest [Liberty Alliance](http://www.projectliberty.org/) news, many of them stopping by my booth afterwards to see OpenSSO in action. Special shouts to [Takashi](http://blogs.sun.com/shita/) and [Tatsuo](http://blogs.sun.com/tkudo/) for making me so welcome in Tokyo, as always. [Via Tatsuo](http://blogs.sun.com/tkudo/entry/friday_night_after_liberty_workshop), [here are some pics](http://blog.livedoor.jp/champattheroom/archives/64848769.html) from our excursion on the last night there - I'm the balding caucasian guy in the blue t-shirt ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)

Moving on... the preso at [TriLUG](http://trilug.org/) last night - 'Digital Identity from LDAP to SAML and Beyond' - went well - about 60 or so _very_ technical attendees. When I asked how many people in the audience did NOT understand [sequence diagrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram), only a couple of hands went up, and I breathed a sigh of relief as I explained the basics.

A BIG thankyou to [Andy Oliver](http://blog.buni.org/blog/acoliver/) and the rest of TriLUG for the invitation to speak - it's a pleasure to talk to a well-informed, interested audience who are there by choice, not because it's their job ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif). As promised, [here are the slides [PDF]](http://blog.superpat.com/images/Identity_TriLUG2007.pdf). There should be some video at some point too; I'll update this blog entry when it appears.

_UPDATE_ - [ogg and mp3 audio available](http://www.trilug.org/node/69). Listen to my voice gradually die due to the cold I'm [suffering](http://youtube.com/watch?v=rXLHWmjA5IE).

_UPDATE 2_ - thanks to [Rich](http://blogs.sun.com/sharps/) for the photo, and for providing accommodation at [Pixelfodder Towers](http://flickr.com/photos/sharples/1250524570) for the whole Patterson clan ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)

_UPDATE 3_ - thanks to [Takayuki](http://blogs.sun.com/okazaki/) for the photos from the Liberty Tokyo event. [Here's a nice one of Tatsuo and me](http://flickr.com/photos/okazaki/1776114852/in/set-72157602740361280/).

So - where next? [IIW2007b](http://www.windley.com/events/iiw2007b/) in Mountain View, December 3-5, then [Javapolis](http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/Home), in Antwerp, December 10-14\. That'll be about it for 2007\. Hopefully.
