There's a lot of buzz around 'user-centric identity' right now - the notion of involving users in the management of their personal information and its use, rather than leaving it to some enterprise or other organization. The folks at the [Liberty Alliance](http://www.projectliberty.org/) have written a whitepaper entitled '[Personal Identity](https://www.projectliberty.org/about/whitepapers/Personal_Identity.pdf)' that shows how Liberty's Identity Federation Framework (ID-FF) and its successor SAML 2.0 can be used to implement user-centric identity - for example, a user providing their own identity services via a Liberty-enabled device such as a cellphone. It's a good read - it starts from the basics, so you should be able to follow it even if you're new to Liberty and SAML.

![](http://blog.superpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/nseries.png) On the same topic, [John Kemp](http://appliedlife.blogspot.com/) of [Nokia](http://www.nokia.com) and my esteemed colleague [Hubert Le Van Gong](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/hubertsblog) will be presenting a webcast on April 12 2006 at 8am Pacific. **PLEASE NOTE:** Registration is required and limited to the first 100 respondents! The last webcast on the Liberty People Service 'sold out' very quickly, so get in there straight away if you're interested. If you're too late, don't despair - the webcast will be available in archive form after the event. I'll update this entry with the URL once it's online.

To register for the webcast, follow these steps.

1.  Go to [http://projectliberty.webex.com](http://projectliberty.webex.com)
2.  Under the heading Attend a Meeting, click Register
3.  Search for _centric_
4.  Select _User Centric Identity: Success Today_ and click on the Register Button. (Don't bother clicking on the link - it doesn't lead anywhere useful!)
5.  Fill out the required information and click Register Now at the bottom of the page.

Please email [Tricia DeHart](mailto:tricia@projectliberty.org?subject=User Centric Identity Webcast Question) of the Liberty Alliance Project with any questions.
