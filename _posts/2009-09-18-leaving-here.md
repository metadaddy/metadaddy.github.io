They say that all good things come to an end; today, that's true for both Superpatterns at blogs.sun.com and my nearly ten year tenure at Sun. It's certainly been a [wild ride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Toad%27s_Wild_Ride), and I've enjoyed (amost!) every minute of it! My blog will move to [blog.superpat.com](http://blog.superpat.com/) (If you've been using the [FeedBurner feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/superpat), there's no need to make any changes) at some point in the next day or so, and I'll be starting a new job on Monday.

I'm setting up the new blog right now (thanks to [Arun Gupta](http://blog.arungupta.me/) for [his suggestion](http://blogs.sun.com/arungupta/entry/this_blog_is_moving) of [WordPress hosting at GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/hosting/wordpress-hosting.aspx)), and I'll be blogging on my new gig next week. In the meantime, here's 'Leaving Here' from the mighty Mot√∂rhead:

<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UaFTlcfGECU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UaFTlcfGECU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></object>

By the way, fellow pedants, it's 'Leaving Here' (with a 'g') - the YouTube caption is wrong. [Evidence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Here_%28Mot%C3%B6rhead_song%29).
