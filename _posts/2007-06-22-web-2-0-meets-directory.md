Friday lunchtime is my slot for catching up with podcasts. Today I listened to [Trey](http://blogs.sun.com/treydrake/), [Don](http://blogs.sun.com/wizidm/) and [Brandon](http://www.brandonwhichard.com/) discussing the [OpenDS](https://opends.dev.java.net/) project and its [Atom/LDAP offshoot](https://atom.dev.java.net/) - '[Web 2.0 Meets Directory](http://blogs.sun.com/idmbuzz/entry/web_2_0_meets_directory)'. Good stuff and quite funny as they rib Trey a little over [James Governor](http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/)'s assessment of the Atom/LDAP mashup as "[the coolest work at Sun Microsystems right now](http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/2007/05/31/most-exciting-idea-in-ages-an-atomldap-mashup/)". Of course, I would submit that OpenDS and Atom/LDAP are actually just a little way off being [the coolest project at Sun](https://opensso.dev.java.net/). But then, I would, wouldn't I? ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)
