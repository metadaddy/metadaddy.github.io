[Nice article covering yesterday's Liberty Alliance webcast](http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1232137,00.html) from Rich Seeley over at [SearchWebServices.com](http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/). [All the URLs for that webcast and this week's closely related podcast are here](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/podcasting_and_webcasting).

It's great to see momentum building in this whole area - [Liberty](http://projectliberty.org/), [SAML](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security#samlv20), [OpenID](http://openid.net/), [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/)... As I say in the podcast, this is a tremendously exciting time to be involved in digital identity.
