The slides for my OpenSSO presentation at [Jazoon 08](http://jazoon.com/) (last week) are now online - just click on the link from the [session page at the Jazoon 08 site](http://jazoon.com/jazoon08/en/conference/presentationdetails.html?type=sid&detail=5245). If you attended my session, you can give it a rating (out of 5 stars) at that page. You can also see [my photos from Jazoon 08 in a Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/superpat/sets/72157605823614382/).
