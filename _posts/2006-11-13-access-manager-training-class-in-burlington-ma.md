There are a small number of places available on the [Sun Java System Access Manager: Configuration and Customization (AM-3480)](http://www.sun.com/training/catalog/courses/AM-3480.xml) at Sun's training center in Burlington, MA the week of Dec 4\. This presentation of the course is taught by the most excellent Allan Foster; Allan taught the recent [Federation Manager Boot Camp](http://blogs.sun.com/hubertsblog/entry/federation_manager_bootcamp_-_contact) course on which [Hubert](http://blogs.sun.com/hubertsblog/) [heaped lavish praise](http://blogs.sun.com/hubertsblog/entry/federation_manager_a_bootcamp_to), so you know you're in good hands.

If you're in the North-East and you feel your AM knowledge is lacking, then [take a look](http://www.sun.com/training/catalog/courses/AM-3480.xml) and consider signing up - your department may well have some training budget that needs to be used or lost before the end of the year...
