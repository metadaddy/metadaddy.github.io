Number three in an [occasional](celebspotting-at-javapolis) [series](celebspotting-at-narita). As I mentioned in the [previous entry](opensso-download-evaluate-deploy), I was at a SEED event this morning, up at our Menlo Park campus. As we broke for lunch I got talking to [Scott Fehrman](https://blogs.oracle.com/sfehrman/) and [Whitfield Diffie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie), and accompanied them to a very nice lunch. Of course, I couldn't let the occasion pass without whipping out the iPhone and asking Scott to do the honors now, could I? :-)
