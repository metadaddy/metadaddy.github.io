Number three in an [occasional](http://blog.superpat.com/2007/12/17/celebspotting-at-javapolis/) [series](http://blog.superpat.com/2007/10/22/celebspotting-at-narita/). As I mentioned in the [previous entry](http://blog.superpat.com/2008/04/11/opensso-download-evaluate-deploy/), I was at a SEED event this morning, up at our Menlo Park campus. As we broke for lunch I got talking to [Scott Fehrman](https://blogs.oracle.com/sfehrman/) and [Whitfield Diffie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie), and accompanied them to a very nice lunch. Of course, I couldn't let the occasion pass without whipping out the iPhone and asking Scott to do the honors now, could I? :-)
