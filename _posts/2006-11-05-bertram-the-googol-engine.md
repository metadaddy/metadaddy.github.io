_Count the zeros - it's absolutely correct!_

A conversation, some weeks ago. The scene: Tom and I searching the web for pictures of bridges, using a well known search engine.

*   Tom: "Daddy, what's a 'Google'?"
*   Me: "It's a website you can use to search for things."
*   Tom: "Why is it called 'Google'?"
*   Me: "Because there are lots of things and 'googol' is a very big number."
*   Tom: "How big, daddy?"
*   Me: "Very big - if you wanted to write it you'd put a one then a hundred zeros."
*   _Thoughtful silence._

The other day:

*   Mummy: "What's that you're drawing, Tom?"
*   Tom (painstakingly counting zeros as he writes them onto a line drawing of a locomotive): "It's [Bertram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Thomas_%26_Friends_characters#Narrow_gauge_engines). He doesn't have a number, so I'm making him the googol engine."
