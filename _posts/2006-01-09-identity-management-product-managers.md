If you are a product manager in the field of identity management, you're probably used to having a job title that sounds like a tongue twister - for example, my good friend Eric Leach is the 'Access Manager Product Manager' (did somebody say "Red Lorry, Yellow Lorry"?). If you have such a tongue twisting title, or you'd like one, take a look at this [job req](http://www.sun.com/corp_emp/search.cgi?req=545275). The upside - you'd get to be part of [Sara Gates](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/saragates)' [merry band](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/saragates?entry=pics_from_burton_catalyst_in). The downside - uh - you'd get to be part of Sara Gates' merry... OK - lame joke, cool job.
