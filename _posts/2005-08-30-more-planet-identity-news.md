The blog entries come thick and fast tonight. Again, if you're a regular [Planet Identity](http://planetidentity.org/) reader, you might have noticed a little <strike>disturbance in the Force</strike> shuffle in the blogroll. Since [Eric Norlin](http://ericnorlin.typepad.com/weblog/) and [Dick Hardt](http://blame.ca/dick) now do their Identity related blogging elsewhere (Eric at [Digital ID World](http://blog.digitalidworld.com/) and [Ping Identity](http://blog.pingidentity.com/blog/), Dick at [Identity 2.0](http://identity20.com/) and [Sxip](http://sxip.com/blog)), and with their agreement (not that I need it - bwah-ha-ha-ha-ha - sorry), I've removed their personal weblogs from the [Planet](http://planetidentity.org/).  
How do you find the current signal/noise ratio at [Planet Identity](http://planetidentity.org/)? About right? Not enough cat-related posts? Too many? Should I be working harder to sort the wheat from the chaff? Comments welcome!
