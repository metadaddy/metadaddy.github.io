[![ForgeRock](http://blog.superpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/forgerock-banner-logo.jpg "ForgeRock"){: .align-left}](http://www.forgerock.com/opensso-ug.html)My [friends](http://www.forgerock.com/teams.html) at [ForgeRock](http://www.forgerock.com/) are bringing their [series of OpenSSO user group meetings](http://www.forgerock.com/opensso-ug.html) to the USA and Canada in late March/early April 2010\. If you're interested in where they're taking open source identity, you should definitely take this opportunity to participate in one of the meetings - choose from New York (3/29), Toronto (3/30), Chicago (3/31) or San Francisco (4/1). I'll likely take the drive up 280 to the SF event on April 1st - see you there!
