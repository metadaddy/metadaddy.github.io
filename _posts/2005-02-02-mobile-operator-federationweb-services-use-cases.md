My principal role, since I turned away from the 'dark side' of marketing and moved back into engineering, is technical architect for federation standards on Sun's Java<sup>TM</sup> System Access Manager product. This means I get to work with some great technology and, more importantly, some great people. One such person is Fulup Ar Foll; Fulup is another techie, a [Breton](http://www.breizh.net/saozneg/), and _the_ goto guy for mobile federation/web services.  

Fulup and I recently contributed to a joint [Nokia/Sun whitepaper](http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/content/download/394/2741/file/Nokia_Sun_US_2812.pdf) on identity federation and web services. The domain is mobile operators, but the paper covers a number of variations on the basic Liberty 'circle of trust'/'identity provider'/'service provider' model that can apply to any industry. It's pretty technical, but essential reading if you want to understand the future of mobile services.
