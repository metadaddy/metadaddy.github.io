If you are working with Java on OS X, then you are probably aware of [13949712720901ForOSX](http://www.google.com/search?q=13949712720901ForOSX), a call for Apple to support [Java 6](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/) on [Mac OS X Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/).

My personal take on this (stressing the personal - despite my highly exalted position at Sun ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif) I have no insider knowledge) is that Java 6 was in Leopard at some point in time (witness the Java 6 developer preview download at [ADC](http://developer.apple.com/) - long gone now). [Apple put resources into iPhone at the expense of Leopard](http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/04/12/leoparddelay/index.php). I reckon that Java 6 was cut to bring in Leopard's ship date, and Java 5 hastily put in its place, hence [the Java 5 issues we are seeing](http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t102936.html).

All of this would be of little import, were Apple not dealing with a developer community that has become [addicted to openness](http://openjdk.java.net/). Apple's ruthless, consumer-oriented, information management just doesn't work with this crowd. And, devoid of any official position from Apple, the community assumes the worst. It's only a matter of time before the first blog entry appears alleging that Java 6 was dropped from Leopard because Steve Jobs spends too much time eating babies (oops - [there it is!](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Java+6+was+dropped+from+Leopard+because+Steve+Jobs+spends+too+much+time+eating+babies%22) ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)).

I guess the first we'll hear from Apple is when the download appears in Software Update. It can't happen too soon...
