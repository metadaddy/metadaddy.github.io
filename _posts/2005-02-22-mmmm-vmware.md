You just have to love [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/)... I'm now syncing the Clie via USB to Palm Desktop on Windows XP, running on VMware, running on Java Desktop System.  
Now, logically, these are all just layers of software, and it should all just work, but I'm still pretty amazed when it does!
