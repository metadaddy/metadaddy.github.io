These are my links for October 26th 2010:

*   [Google Search for Salesforce.com openings that mention 'identity'](http://www.google.com/search?q=%2Bidentity+site%3Awww.salesforce.com%2Fcompany%2Fcareers%2Flocations) - [LOTS of jobs open at Salesforce.com](http://www.salesforce.com/company/careers/locations/) - this link filters out the identity-related reqs. Just one right now, but that will certainly change. Substitute 'identity' in the URL with your particular interest...
*   [Getting Started with the Force.com REST API - developer.force.com](http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Getting_Started_with_the_Force.com_REST_API) - This tutorial shows the basics of using the Force.com REST API. It walks through a simple Java Web application that authenticates the user to Force.com via OAuth 2.0, then creates, reads, updates, and deletes Force.com Account records via the new API. Note: As of Winter â€™11 the Force.com REST API is still in Developer Preview and should not be used for production until its GA in a future release.
