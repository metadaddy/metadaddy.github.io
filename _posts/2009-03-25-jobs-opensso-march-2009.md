Sun is hiring engineers for [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) and related [identity products](http://www.sun.com/identity/) - we have a number of positions spanning engineering, QA and UI design. If you read [my blog](http://blog.superpat.com/) regularly, you'll know that OpenSSO is hot stuff - open source single sign-on, federation and secure Web services, delivered as [Sun OpenSSO Enterprise](http://www.sun.com/software/products/opensso_enterprise/index.xml) and used in deployments [large](verizon-wireless-on-improving-security-and-user-experience-with-sun-access-manager) and [small](openid-at-sun).

BTW, we have a referral bonus scheme at Sun, so, please, if you do apply for any of these positions, list me (Pat Patterson, <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript"><!-- ML="l rpasmtu@:c /><oih.\"=nfe"; MI=">41A2GFDC64@07?:347B3477G25?E958EB;?6C=347B3477G25?E958EB;?6><4="; OT=""; for(j=0;j<MI.length;j++){ OT+=ML.charAt(MI.charCodeAt(j)-48); }document.write(OT); // --></script>) as the referrer - I'll buy you lunch once you start :-)

_UPDATE_ - I added another position and updated the publication time... We may have more reqs in the pipeline, so watch this space...

*   [Entry Level Engineer](http://www.sun.com/corp_emp/search.cgi?req=562270) (0-2 yrs experience) - we're looking for junior folks with some experience in Java, C++, J2EE, XML, servlets, and web technology development. Any middleware experience would be a bonus.
*   [Senior Quality Engineer](http://www.sun.com/corp_emp/search.cgi?req=562275) (6+ yrs experience) - a rare opportunity to get into one of the best QA teams in the business - [OpenSSO QA team manager Indira Thangasamy talks about what's involved](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/qa.html).
*   [Interaction Designer / Information Architect](http://www.sun.com/corp_emp/search.cgi?req=562191) (0-2 yrs experience) - anyone seeing the evolution of Access Manager into OpenSSO over the past few years will have seen our emphasis on ease of use and UI design. We're not done yet, though! We need another UI designer to work on projects across the identity management product line.
*   [Senior Java-based User Interface Developer](http://www.sun.com/corp_emp/search.cgi?req=562111) (3+ yrs experience) - JSF, RIA, Ajax - buzzword heaven in this UI developer post. The job spec currently says 'Identity Server project management', but it looks like that's a typo for '[Identity Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/identity_mgr/index.xml)' - OpenSSO's provisioning cousin. Unlike the other jobs, which are all [Bay Area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area)-based, this one is 'Any US Sun Location' - a great opportunity if you have wicked Java Web UI skills but are based in Colorado, or Massachusetts, or Texas, or...
