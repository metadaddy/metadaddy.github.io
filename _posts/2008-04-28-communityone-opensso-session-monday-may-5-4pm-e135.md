I mentioned our upcoming [CommunityOne](http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone/) session back when I posted my [Spring/Summer schedule](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/spring_summer_2008_event_calendar); now I have a time and place, since the [CommunityOne schedule](http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone/pdfs/CommunityOne2008_agenda.pdf) was just published. We'll be presenting "[OpenSSO Workshop: Creating Federated Relationships with Software as a Service, Social Networking, and Web 2.0 Applications](http://www28.cplan.com/cc197/session_details.jsp?isid=297300&ilocation_id=197-1&ilanguage=english)" **on Monday May 5 at 4pm in Hall E 135**.

By the way, CommunityOne is **free of charge** to attend, though [**you do need to register**](http://www.cplan.com/sun/communityone2008/registration/). See you there!
