Remember [I was blogging about the great people you get to work with here at Sun](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat/20050202#mobile_operator_federation_web_services)? Well, one of the best is Don Bowen, Product Line Manager for Directory Server. I first met Don in Munich at the Burton Catalyst Conference in 2002 - gosh, was it really only 2Â½ years ago? Don knows _everybody_ in the industry - he was working in identity management before it was even called identity management. If you're on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com), his profile is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&key=800394). If you're not on LinkedIn, and you work in tech, sign up, RIGHT NOW! It's the single most efficient mode of networking I know, and a great way to get back in touch with people you used to work with.  
Anyway - back to the point. Don has recorded a '[Take 10](https://see.sun.com/Apps/DCS/mcp?q=STd069TFaqKXIk&classcode=SNTA-T10_DIRECTORY&eventid=e9ww9952)' - a < 10 minute presentation on [Directory Server Enterprise Edition](http://www.sun.com/software/products/directory_srvr_ee/index.xml) ('DSEE'), explaining why we now talk about the directory _service_ rather than a directory _server_ and the huge functionality included as standard in DSEE. There is also a [white paper](http://www.sun.com/software/products/identity/wp_directory_services_id_mgmt.pdf) explaining in more detail just what we mean by a 'directory service'.  
Go take a look, and feel free to leave a comment here with feedback - I'll make sure it gets to Don.
