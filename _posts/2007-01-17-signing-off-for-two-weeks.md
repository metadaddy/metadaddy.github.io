Well - Familia Patterson is off to London today for [brother-in-law](http://skiversgigs.blogspot.com/)'s wedding. [Kim Cameron](http://www.identityblog.com/) [responded](http://www.identityblog.com/?p=652) to [my recent entry on minimal disclosure in CardSpace/InfoCard](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/infocard_and_minimal_disclosure) - unfortunately I won't get a chance to follow up on that for a couple of weeks.

Oh - and [Scott Kveton](http://kveton.com/blog) just added me to [Planet OpenID](http://planet.openid.net/). Thanks, Scott!
