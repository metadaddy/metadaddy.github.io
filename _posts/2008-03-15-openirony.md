[Kaliya wonders](http://www.identitywoman.net/?p=740) "if OpenID has been used for activism yet?", then, in a footnote:

> Sorry - I am really trying to get openID to work on this hoster (well my tech person Lucy is) there is still something not working. So if you want to comment either link to this blog post and say it on your own site or send me e-mail kaliya (at) mac (dot) com. If any of you OpenID tech folks want to see if you can help her solve the problem let me know I will put you in touch.

There's really nothing I can add...
