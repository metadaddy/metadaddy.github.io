I'm in Brussels this week for the [Liberty Alliance Plenary Meeting and IOS Brussels](https://events.projectliberty.org/details.php?id=11), but, back at the ranch in California, the [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/) folks have released another technical article on Access Manager: [Achieving SSO With Sun Java System Access Manager and SAML](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/sso.html), a look at how to integrate [Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/) with a third party application - in this case [SAP NetWeaver Enterprise Portal 2004s](https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/portal) - via SAML.
