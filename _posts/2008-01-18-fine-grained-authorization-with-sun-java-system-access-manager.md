Following on from last June's [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/) article on [Basic Authorization with Sun Java System Access Manager](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/secureapps.html), [Robert Skoczylas](http://robskocz.blogspot.com/) of [Indigo Consulting](http://www.indigoconsulting.com/) and Sun tech author [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) recently published a second article, [Developing Secure Applications with Sun Java System Access Manager, Part 2: Advanced Authorization](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/secureapps2.html).

This time, Robert and Marina look at how [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/) can be used as a general purpose policy store, and, with some customization, can provide fine-grained authorization for UI elements rendered by both Java and .NET web applications. This is a great article to read if you've wondered how Access Manager can be used to authorize access to resources other that the usual web page URLs.
