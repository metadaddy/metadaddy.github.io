Well - [it's done](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/features/sun_microsoft.html). I've been involved in the web single sign-on interoperability work with Microsoft since the beginning of the year - four and a half months of painstaking specification work, designing a demo, going on vacation while the real engineers built the demo ![](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/images/smileys/smile.gif) (BIG kudos to Emily for the protocol work and Lauren for the web pages on our side, Ryan on the MS side - the demo worked flawlessly and looked great!) then a final flurry of work on the demo script and rehearsals for the big day.  
Watch the [webcast](http://wcdata.sun.com/webcast/archives/VIP-2050/) - I'm presenting the demo with Don Schmidt of Microsoft. There's a [press release](http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2005-05/sunflash.20050513.1.html) (if that's your sort of thing) and a [factsheet](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/features/MSSunFS.pdf). The actual specs are online at [Sun](http://developers.sun.com/techtopics/identity/interop/index.html) and [Microsoft](http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/wssecurspecindex.asp). I'm not going to repeat any of that here. I will say that it is somewhat nerve-wracking giving a live presentation just 6 feet from Steve Ballmer and Scott McNealy! AND - there is no truth in the rumour that I am Steve Ballmer's 'good twin'...  
I've read blogs and comments that represent this as Sun moving from open to proprietary standards. This is emphatically not the case. The big news, as I see it, is that customers now have a way to implement SSO with the upcoming Active Directory Federation Services that would otherwise not exist. These specifications are published and will be submitted to a standards process, so other identity management vendors can implement them or not as they see fit.
