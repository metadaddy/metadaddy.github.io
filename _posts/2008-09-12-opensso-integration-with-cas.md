Hot on the heels of [last week's Jira plugin](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/opensso_integration_with_atlassian_jira), Qingfeng Zhang (all I have is the name) has [posted an an entry to the JA-SIG CAS wiki](http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/CAS/CASifying+Sun+Access+Manager) explaining how to integrate [Sun Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.jsp) (aka [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/)) with [JA-SIG](http://www.ja-sig.org/) [CAS](http://www.ja-sig.org/products/cas/) via an OpenSSO authentication module. This integration lets users login to CAS and access resources protected by OpenSSO. Nice work!

Again, I haven't tried this out yet, but, if you have, [let me know in the comments](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/opensso_integration_with_cas#comments) how you got on...
