Tech author [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) over at [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/) [continues her series of interviews](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/fedaccess.html); this time in the hot seat is [Daniel Raskin](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/), senior product line manager for [access](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/) and [federation management](http://www.sun.com/software/products/federation_mgr/) at Sun.

[In the interview](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/fedaccess.html), Daniel lifts the lid on some of the cool new features coming up in [Sun Federated Access Manager 8.0](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/federated_access_manager_roadmap) (and, of course, available NOW in [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/)), including [Fedlets](http://fedlet.com/), Virtual Federation, the Federation Validator and more. [Exciting stuff!](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/fedaccess.html)
