Wow - I just looked at the new [Project Liberty market adoption page](http://www.projectliberty.org/about/marketadoption.php). It seems we've been hiding the Liberty light under a bushel - particularly when you look at adoption in the [Telecommunications](http://www.projectliberty.org/about/adoption_telecom.php) and [Online Service Provider](http://www.projectliberty.org/about/adoption_serviceproviders.php) segments. One of the strengths of the Liberty specifications is that they can become transparent infrastructure - [AOL](http://www.aol.com) users don't need to know that Liberty's Web Services Framework (ID-WSF) is [being used to link AOL's services with third-party applications](http://www.projectliberty.org/about/adoption_serviceproviders.php#aol). On the other hand, this doesn't lend itself to market awareness.

Congratulations and thanks to Britta, [Lauren](http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/) and the rest of the Liberty Business and Marketing Expert Group (BMEG) for driving this to completion, and to all Liberty members who contributed information. If you know of a Liberty deployment that is not listed, then please [submit it online](http://www.projectliberty.org/about/marketadoption.php). As you can see from the current list, you can be [listed anonymously](http://www.projectliberty.org/about/adoption_serviceproviders.php#germansp) or even not at all. In the latter case, the information is still valuable for aggregate measures such as 'total number of Liberty-enabled devices and identities'
