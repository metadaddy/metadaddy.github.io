Prompted by [Ludo](http://blogs.sun.com/Ludo/)'s [recent entry on OpenDS @ Ohloh](http://blogs.sun.com/Ludo/entry/opends_project_tracked_in_ohloh)...

A few weeks ago, I discovered the [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/) project page on [Ohloh](http://www.ohloh.net/), tracking information related to the OpenSSO community.

The [Ohloh OpenSSO page](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3793) provides links and news about the OpenSSO project, direct access to the Download area, license information and metrics such as number of developers, commit statistics per day and per developer, number of lines of code and much more.

If you are using OpenSSO, please add it to your stack on Ohloh, show us where you are located, and, if you want to provide a user review, you're more than welcome.
