[Interesting post](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=6497195&forum_id=33773) by Joseph Chiusano of Booz Allen Hamilton to the [sunxacml-discuss mailing list](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sunxacml-discuss) discussing US Federal Government classification of standards and specifications. Key quote (my links):

> [XACML](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xacml) would be considered to be a "Voluntary Consensus Standard (VCS)" (aka an "open standard") according to [OMB Circular A-119[1]](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a119/a119.html), the authoritative federal mandate on this topic. [WS-Policy](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/specification/ws-polfram/) and [WS-Trust](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/specification/ws-trust/), however, would not be considered VCSs.

It is important to understand the difference between a standard and a specification - imho, _standards_ are created in organizations (such as [OASIS](http://www.oasis-open.org/), [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) and [Liberty](http://www.projectliberty.org/)) whose membership is open to all. Non-standard _Specifications_ on the other hand, are created by [consortia](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=consortia) of vendors outside standards bodies such as the above. That's not to denigrate their usefulness in any way, but the difference in process can be significant - open standards level the playing field; in contrast, you can never be sure whether a multi-lateral specification favours the members' products. In fact, it would be somewhat irrational if it did not.
