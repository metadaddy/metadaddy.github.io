I've been reading James McGovern's [Enterprise Architecture: Thought Leadership](http://duckdown.blogspot.com/) for some time now. I have to say, I disagree with James on a lot of things ([for example...](http://onesearch.sun.com/search/blog/index.jsp?col=blog&charset=utf-8&weblog=superpat&qt=mcgovern)), but his entry today on ['bell curve compensation'](http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2007/04/is-bell-curve-compensation-anti-pattern.html) is spot on. Just how _do_ you compensate employees fairly where there are some teams of superstars, some 'normal' teams and some composed entirely of dim bulbs?
