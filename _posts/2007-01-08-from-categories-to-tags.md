I finally got round to completing Superpatterns' migration from categories (exactly one category per post) to tags (zero or more tags per post). You can see the tag cloud at the top of the page (if you're reading this through syndication you'll have to visit [my actual web page](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat) to see this). The size of each tag name in the tag cloud relates to the number of blog entries with that tag. If you still want to navigate by categories, they are listed in the dropdown near the top of the column on the right.

Thanks to [Rich Sharples](http://blogs.sun.com/sharps) for the [category chooser tip](http://blogs.sun.com/sharps/entry/hacking_roller_templates_category_chooser) and to [Dave Levy](http://blogs.sun.com/DaveLevy) for the [tag cloud idea](http://blogs.sun.com/DaveLevy/entry/more_about_tag_clouds_on).
