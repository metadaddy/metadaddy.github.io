Wow - it's been nearly 7 weeks since the [last tab sweep](http://blog.superpat.com/2009/01/09/opensso-tab-sweep-jan-10-2009/), not so much due to a lack of [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) news, quite the reverse - so much going on that I've not had 2 minutes to sit down and document it. Anyway, here we go...

*   Top of the pile this time is Sun Senior Identity Management Architect [Warren Strange](http://blogs.sun.com/warren/). Warren has been working on integrating OpenSSO with [Grails](http://www.grails.org/), and, along the way, has refined OpenSSO's [Authentication Provider for Spring Security 2.0](https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/extensions/#authnproviders) to better support authorization. Get the full scoop at [Spring comes early - an updated OpenSSO Spring Security provider](http://blogs.sun.com/warren/entry/spring_comes_early_to_opensso).
*   [Mike ('Horto')](http://www.horto.ca/) and [Marina](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) published the [second half of their article on Enabling Virtual Federation With OpenSSO](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/virtual-federation2.html). [As I mentioned when I linked to the first part](http://blog.superpat.com/2009/01/16/enabling-virtual-federation-with-opensso/), this is a distillation of Mike's experience in the Canadian banking sector - essential reading if you're looking at federation-enabling legacy applications.  
    Incidentally, Marina is no longer with Sun; if you're looking for a top-drawer writer, you should get in touch with her ([leave a comment here](http://blog.superpat.com/2009/02/27/opensso-tab-sweep-feb-27-2009/#respond) - I'll see your email address and forward it to Marina, but it won't appear on the comment). You can read acres of Marina's writing in [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/)'s [Identity Management Technical Articles](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/index.jsp). Marina is sorely missed by all of us in identity at Sun.
*   Over at [BigAdmin](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/), [Murthy](http://blogs.sun.com/webtier/), [Meena](http://blogs.sun.com/meena/), and [Hubert](http://bug4free.wordpress.com/) give an admin's eye view of [OpenID.sun.com: A Sun Java System Web Server 7.0 Reference Deployment](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/openid_web_server.jsp). You'll need to register and login to BigAdmin to get the article (delivered as a PDF), but it's well worth it, since that account will get you into pretty much all of Sun's Internet-facing resources. And, of course, what do we use to provide single sign-on across sun.com? You guessed it, OpenSSO. Well, technically, Sun Access Manager, OpenSSO's predecessor, but it's all the same code :-)
*   Top Gun Sun Identity Management Specialist [Derrick Harcey](http://blogs.sun.com/harcey/) recently posted a set of [Identity Suite Essentials Tutorials](http://blogs.sun.com/harcey/entry/identity_suite_essentials_tutorials), covering both OpenSSO and its sister product [Sun Identity Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/identity_mgr/index.xml). Valuable resources for folks working with [Sun's identity product suite](http://www.sun.com/identity/).
*   Finally, of course, no OpenSSO tab sweep would be complete without a contribution from [Daniel](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/), our very own smoking monkey. [This time, Daniel's made a video highlighting prototype one-time password support in OpenSSO](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/roadmap_preview_1x_password_w). You're having far too much fun PM'ing OpenSSO, Daniel - stop it!

That wraps it up for February. Watch out for more exciting OpenSSO news coming soon!
