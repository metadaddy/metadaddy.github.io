[SOAWorld](http://soa.sys-con.com/) have extended the closing date for votes in their [Readers' Choice Awards](http://soa.sys-con.com/general/rcvote.htm) until the end of the year - Dec 31st. And IBM DataPower has pulled ahead of [Sun Access Manager/OpenSSO](http://www2.sys-con.com/webservices/readerschoice2004/tiny.cfm?id=77), by [540 votes to 345](http://www2.sys-con.com/webservices/readerschoice2004/frameliveupdate.cfm?BType=10).

So... We NEED your vote... If you haven't voted already, [go now and vote](http://soa.sys-con.com/general/rcvote.htm) for OpenSSO in the Best Security Solution category. You could also vote for GlassFish in Best App Server and NetBeans in Best IDE, but I'm calling for votes for OpenSSO!!!

PLEASE - go vote now. And tell your friends. Vote, vote, vote!!!
