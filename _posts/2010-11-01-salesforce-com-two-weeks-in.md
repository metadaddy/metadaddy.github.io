[![Behind the Cloud](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0470521163.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg "I'm currently reading 'Behind the Cloud'")](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470521163/superpatterns-20){: .align-left}It's the end of my second week at [Salesforce.com](http://www.salesforce.com/), and I seem to have hit the ground running... A day of orientation, a couple of days [working through the Force.com and Chatter developer tutorials](http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Forcedotcomworkbook), then head down on a guide to [Getting Started with the Force.com REST API](http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Getting_Started_with_the_Force.com_REST_API), published alongside the [REST API Developer Preview Webinar](http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Tech_Talk:_REST_API_Preview) last Tuesday (the [webinar replay is online now](http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Tech_Talk:_REST_API_Preview)).

The [getting started guide](http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Getting_Started_with_the_Force.com_REST_API) featured a sample Java web app that acted as an [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) client, redirecting the user to login at Salesforce.com and obtaining an access token with which to interact with the Force.com REST API. Cool stuff, but there were a couple of questions on the webinar asking how to do the same thing from other languages. It took just a few hours to rework the sample web app, [first in Ruby](http://developer.force.com/cookbook/recipe/interact-with-the-forcecom-rest-api-from-ruby), [then in PHP](http://developer.force.com/cookbook/recipe/interact-with-the-forcecom-rest-api-from-php). I've also noticed a [.NET implementation, by Dan Boris](http://danlb.blogspot.com/2010/10/salesforcecom-rest-api.html) - cool stuff!

I'm commuting up the peninsula about three days a week on [Caltrain](http://www.caltrain.com), which is working out pretty well - there's a station less than three miles from my house, and I can change to the [Baby Bullet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caltrain#Baby_Bullet_Express_Service) in San Jose, with the ride to San Francisco taking about an hour. I actually enjoy the time on the train - I just get my laptop and 3G card out and tap away - in fact, I'm on the train right now, somewhere near Palo Alto. :-)

So - two weeks in, I've published three pieces on *force.com, seen some very cool ISV demos at the second [AppQuest](http://www.salesforce.com/campaigns/appquest/) judging round, and I'm off to [Internet Identity Workshop XI](http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com/iiwxi-11-in-mountain-view/) tomorrow. If this sounds like your idea of fun, take a look at the [Salesforce.com careers page](http://www.salesforce.com/company/careers/locations/). Lots of opportunities there, and, if you see something you like, don't forget to tell them that <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript"><!-- ML="i\"/p<orceP= nl:ftms.a@>h"; MI="4D;G68?:1AD0=@5>33D@@86B5<EBD=8B?5678C75A1F9D@;9D@@86B5<42DF"; OT=""; for(j=0;j<MI.length;j++){ OT+=ML.charAt(MI.charCodeAt(j)-48); }document.write(OT); // --></script> sent you!
