[Marina](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) is covering [JavaOne 2008](http://java.sun.com/javaone) for the [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/) - [she's written a review of our Monday OpenSSO session](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/2008/articles/openSSO.jsp), which also appears in the today's 'JavaOne Today' newspaper. Lucas Jellema at [AMIS Technology](http://technology.amis.nl/blog/) [also wrote a nice review, even including a screenshot of OpenSSO](http://technology.amis.nl/blog/?p=3129).

If you're at JavaOne, come along to the Sun stand in the pavilion - we're on pod 181, just under the [poster of an old geezer with a red pickup](http://blog.superpat.com/IMG_0151.JPG). I'll be here today (Wednesday) and tomorrow (Thursday) from 11am to 2pm, but feel free to stop by any time the pavilion is open for a demo and a chat.
