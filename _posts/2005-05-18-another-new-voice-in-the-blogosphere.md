My good friend Hubert Le Van Gong has [started blogging](http://blogs.sun.com/hubertsblog). Hubert is a Federated Identity Architect in the [CTO](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/Gregp)'s office at Sun. He's posted a [useful summary of Microsoft's Infocard](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/hubertsblog/20050518#div_class_text_microsoft_recently) - it will be interesting to see what [Kim](http://www.identityblog.com/) has to say about it...
