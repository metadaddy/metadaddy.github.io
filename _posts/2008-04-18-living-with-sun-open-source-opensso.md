This will only be useful if you know MUCH more Japanese than I do, but here's [Yasushi Iwakata](http://blogs.sun.com/iwakata) introducing [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org) at a [Java Hot-Topic Seminar in Tokyo](http://jp.sun.com/company/events/2008/000164.html), [as blogged by Takayuki Okazaki](http://blogs.sun.com/okazaki/entry/%E3%83%9B%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%83%88%E3%83%94%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%BB%E3%83%9F%E3%83%8A%E3%83%BC_2008%E5%B9%B44%E6%9C%88%E5%8F%B7%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9F%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E9%85%8D%E4%BF%A1):

You'll be able to download the slides soon - I'll update this entry with the link.

As he mentions in the video, Iwakata-san has also been working on an [OpenSSO Extension](https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/extensions/) for [Hitachi Finger Vein Authentication](http://www.hitachi.co.jp/Prod/comp/fingervein/global/). You can find the code in the OpenSSO CVS at opensso/extensions/authnhfvb, or [browse it online](https://opensso.dev.java.net/source/browse/opensso/extensions/authnhfvb/). I'll write more about this extension when I get back home from Brazil.
