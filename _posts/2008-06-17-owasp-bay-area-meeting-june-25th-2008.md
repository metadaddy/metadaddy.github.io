Prompted by [James](http://duckdown.blogspot.com/), I signed up a little while ago to the [OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/) Bay Area chapter, keen to learn more about [application security](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_FAQ), both in hardening [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) and [Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.jsp) and in how those projects/products can contribute to securing applications. Well, whaddya know, the next meeting is a half day Application Security Summit at the Microsoft facility in Mountain View next Wednesday, when I'll be out of town. Keen as I am to attend OWASP, I think the [Jazoon](http://jazoon.com/) folks would be a little upset if I didn't show up for [my session on OpenSSO](http://jazoon.com/jazoon08/en/conference/presentationdetails.html?type=sid&detail=5245), so I'll have to be content with encouraging folks in the Bay Area to attend - [all the details are here](http://owaspbajune2008.eventbrite.com/) and, apparently, space is limited, so if you're interested, [sign up now!](http://owaspbajune2008.eventbrite.com/)
