> The next meeting of the [Hartford CT chapter of OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hartford) will occur on February 10th and will feature [Mary Ruddy](http://www.socialphysics.org/mary_ruddy.html.htm) of Project Higgins along with [Ramesh Nagappan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMSJ5BeBAvo) of Sun.

Funnily enough, I've definitely met Mary, but I'm not sure I've ever met [Ramesh](http://www.coresecuritypatterns.com/blogs). I won't get to see him next week, either, since Hartford is about 3,000 miles away from me, but you definitely should, if you're in the area...
