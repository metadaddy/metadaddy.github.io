First [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) tab sweep of 2009, a pretty quiet week, but a few items worth reporting...

*   We started the week with a bang - [400,000 'jarheads' will be using Sun's identity suite to access both classified and unclassified networks](http://blogs.sun.com/ontherecord/entry/sun_microsystems_to_provide_access) - Sun and [BearingPoint](http://www.bearingpoint.com/) will be providing [identity and access management solutions](http://www.sun.com/software/products/identity/) (including [Sun OpenSSO Enterprise](http://www.sun.com/software/products/opensso_enterprise/)) to the [United States Marine Corps](http://www.marines.mil/). We'll be doing our utmost to avoid pissing off that particular group of end-users!
*   Meanwhile, over at the [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/), [Marina (does she ever sleep?) Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) and the [OpenDS](http://www.opends.org/) QA team's Gary Williams bring us [Perspectives on Quality Assurance for OpenDS](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/opends-qa.html), offering some fascinating insights into the tools and techniques used in OpenDS quality assurance. As you might know, OpenSSO uses OpenDS as its embedded configuration store; we'll be adding the capability to use OpenDS as an external user store (an alternative to the currently supported [Sun Directory Server](http://www.sun.com/software/products/directory_srvr_ee/index.jsp) and Microsoft Active Directory) in the next release.
*   Finally, if you thought that Googling [opensso hamster](http://www.google.com/search?q=opensso+hamster) would garner zero hits, you'd be wrong... [SecuGen](http://www.secugen.com/)'s [Hamster Plus](http://www.secugen.com/products/php.htm) and [Hamster IV](http://www.secugen.com/products/ph4.htm) fingerprint biometric readers [are now compatible with Sun Solaris, Sun Ray, and Sunâ€™s Identity Management Solutions, including OpenSSO](http://www.secugen.com/company/pr/20090108SunCollaboration.htm), [which is nice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puMbqfs98JI).

Ah well - at least there are no hits for [opensso potoroo](http://www.google.com/search?q=opensso+potoroo)... Yet... (Yes, it took me many many tries to find an animal that generated zero hits on Google when combined with OpenSSO. A [potoroo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potoroo) is an Australian marsupial - much like a [bandicoot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandicoot). In case you're wondering, there are 28 hits for [opensso bandicoot](http://www.google.com/search?q=opensso+bandicoot). What a strange world we live in...).
