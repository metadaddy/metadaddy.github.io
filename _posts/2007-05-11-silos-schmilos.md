[Ben Laurie](http://www.links.org/) posts flame-bait this morning, with an entry titled '[Liberty Loves Silos](http://www.links.org/?p=229)'. I always find it amazing how folks ascribe the most sinister motivations to [Liberty](http://projectliberty.org/) - maybe now that [a load of our (previously private) mailing lists are publicly visible](http://lists.projectliberty.org/pipermail/Publicly_viewable_members-only_lists/), people will see that we are really fluffy and cuddly (except [Conor](http://conorcahill.blogspot.com/), of course, he's a bit prickly).

Anyway - back to the point... My understanding (I wasn't there for a lot of the early work, so I'm happy to be corrected here) is that the motivation for automated discovery was a seamless user experience. Asking the user for the location of her identity provider, discovery service, calendar service or whatever was seen as a bump in the road, rather than user empowerment. What we're seeing now is a lot of thinking around how we can combine ideas of user identifiers (URLs or [i-names](http://www.xdi.org/i-names-explained.html)) with [SAML 2.0](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security#samlv20) for SSO and [ID-WSF 2.0](http://www.projectliberty.org/resource_center/specifications/liberty_alliance_id_wsf_2_0_specifications) for Web services. For example, [YADIS/SAML](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/yadis%2Fxri_identifier_resolution_with_saml) or [OpenID/ID-WSF](http://connectid.blogspot.com/2007/04/openid-bootstrap-to-id-wsf.html).

In any case, user privacy, consent and control has always been foremost - hence [all the work on defining how a user can consent to attributes being shared between providers [PDF]](http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/content/download/885/6231/file/liberty-idwsf-interaction-svc-v2.0.pdf), not to mention [security and privacy [another PDF, I'm afraid]](http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/content/download/327/2405/file/liberty-idwsf-security-privacy-overview-v1.0.pdf).
