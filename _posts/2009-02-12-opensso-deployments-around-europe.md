News from Europe of some interesting [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) deployments... First, in France, [Capgemini](http://www.capgemini.com/) has been working with [Valeo](http://www.valeo.com/), a major manufacturer of automotive components, to replace a Lotus collaborative platform with [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/apps/) (plus a set of custom web applications) for over 30,000 employees. If you've been keeping up with [Superpatterns](http://blog.superpat.com/), you'll have guessed what they're using to provide Valeo employees with single sign-on across the whole set of web apps... Yep, OpenSSO. [This French story gives some more detail [PDF]](http://blog.superpat.com/09_01_08_01Info_Valeo.pdf).

A couple of stories came out of Norway last year on their government-to-citizen and government-to-business systems, [MinID](https://minid.norge.no/) (My ID) and [Altinn](https://www.altinn.no/) respectively. In April, the Norwegian [Ministry of Government Administration and Reform](http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fad.html?id=339) published '[Clearing the PIN Code Chaos on Public Web Sites](http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fad/press-centre/press-releases/2008/clearing-the-pin-code-chaos-on-public-we.html?id=505957)', describing how citizens had to manage a large number of usernames, passwords and PIN's to access Norway's various government department websites. Then in July, [Accenture](http://www.accenture.com/) [won the contract to implement the next generation of Altinn](http://accenture.tekgroup.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=4711). The 'eID-interoperability hub' and 'advanced security solution' mentioned in the articles? You guessed it... OpenSSO.
