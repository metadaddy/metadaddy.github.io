The [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/) [elves have been hard at work at the cobbler's bench](http://www.addictionrecov.org/paradigm/P_PR_F99/lightenup.htm), publishing new articles in the [identity section](http://developers.sun.com/identity/) and creating a whole new [resource center for scripty folk](http://developers.sun.com/web/scripting/).

First up, [Installing, Configuring, and Deploying Sun Java System Access Manager the Simple Way](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/install.html), by Sun engineer (and [techno buff](http://www.last.fm/user/technoBuff/)!) Anant Kadam and regular SDN tech author [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/), shows how [Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/)'s [WAR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_WAR_%28file_format%29) deployment mechanism allows you to install the product on any of a [variety of containers](http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-4672/6n6qcof1i?a=view#adqdk) in just a few minutes. <whisper>It works on Tomcat and Glassfish as well as the officially supported containers - just don't tell anyone ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif) </whisper>.

Also, the very first article on [OpenDS](http://www.opends.org/) just hit SDN, [Trey Drake](http://treydrake.wordpress.com/) and the ubiquitous Marina present an [introduction to OpenDS](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/opends.html). In case you hadn't heard, OpenDS is Sun's open source directory server project, written in Java and fully compliant with [LDAP v3](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4510). Check out [the article](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/opends.html) and [OpenDS](http://www.opends.org/) itself!

Finally, we have the new [Scripting Resource Center](http://developers.sun.com/web/scripting/) - all sorts of goodies here - JavaScript, Ajax, Ruby, JavaFX, jMaki, PHP, Python, C, DTrace, and more. Set aside a couple of hours before following [this link](http://developers.sun.com/web/scripting/) ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)
