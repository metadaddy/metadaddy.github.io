If you've been paying attention _really_ closely, you might have noticed [Tatsuo](http://blogs.sun.com/tkudo/)'s entry concerning [Planet OpenSSO](http://planets.sun.com/OpenSSO/group/blogs/). This is a new blog aggregation, running on Sun's new [Roller Planet](http://rollerweblogger.org/roller/entry/planet_in_a_mind_map) [infrastructure](http://rollerweblogger.org/roller/entry/planet_sun_com), collecting together the [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/)-related posts from (currently) 10 Sun engineers. I'll add feeds as and when I notice them - please do leave a comment here if there is one that you'd like to see included. Note that, to keep things on-topic, I'm using Roller's tagging feature to filter only entries with the 'opensso' tag, so the signal-to-noise ratio should stay pretty high. Go [check it out](http://planets.sun.com/OpenSSO/group/blogs/).
