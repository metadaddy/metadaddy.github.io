It's been a while since the [last tab sweep](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/opensso_tab_sweep1) - lots of news since then, such as the [OpenSSO Enterprise 8.0 release](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/opensso_enterprise_8_0_released), that's kept me busy both here on the blog and 'in real life' (if there is such a thing any more!). Anyway, here are some of the titbits I've been saving for a tab sweep blog post:

*   I posted another [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) adoption story to the [Stories](http://blogs.sun.com/stories/) blog this morning: [ACA IT-Solutions deploys OpenSSO at Telenet for fine-grained access control](http://blogs.sun.com/stories/entry/telenet). You might remember [I blogged about Telenet a little while ago](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/opensso_live_at_telenet_be), well, when we started covering OpenSSO on the Stories blog, Serge Craeghs of [ACA IT-Solutions](http://www.aca-it.be/) kindly completed the [questionnaire](http://blogs.sun.com/stories/resource/opensso_questionnaire.txt) for the Telenet deployment, with all sorts of juicy details - [read all about it](http://blogs.sun.com/stories/entry/telenet).
*   Another nifty feature of [MarkMail](http://markmail.org/) - project-based homepages. Just go to [http://opensso.markmail.org/](http://opensso.markmail.org/) and you can search and browse just the OpenSSO mailing lists. Very cool!
*   [Bert van Beeck](http://blogs.sun.com/identityfever/) writes about [using SAML 1.x or SAML 2.0 to authenticate SharePoint users](http://blogs.sun.com/identityfever/entry/using_saml_1_x_to), with OpenSSO acting as a bridge between the [Belgian Federal Authentication Service - FAS](http://www.itprofessional.be/toolkit.cfm?id=70918) (a SAML 1.1 identity provider) and Microsoft SharePoint (which can speak WS-Federation, but not plain SAML 1.1).
*   On [The Open Road](http://blogs.sun.com/openroad/), David Goldsmith explains [how to work around issues in GlassFish V3 Prelude's cookie handling to allow OpenSSO to work correctly](http://blogs.sun.com/openroad/entry/installing_opensso_enterprise_8_0), with a nod to [Dennis' diagnosis of the problem](http://dennisseah.wordpress.com/2008/12/07/opensso-on-glassfish-v3-prelude).
*   Although the Fedlet has been available for Java EE platforms for some time now, it's always been our intention to support .Net also, so it's great to see [Rajeev Angal](http://blogs.sun.com/rangal/) putting together a [.Net Fedlet prototype](http://blogs.sun.com/rangal/entry/net_fedlet). Give it a try and let Rajeev know how it goes.
*   Rajeev strikes again, alongside [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/), with a [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/) article on [Federated Single Sign-On for Salesforce in OpenSSO](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/salesforce.html). It's amazing how easy these integrations are now that SAML has become so widespread. There might just be something to these 'standards' we keep hearing about :-)
*   Over at [Core Security Patterns](http://www.coresecuritypatterns.com/blogs), Ramesh Nagappan tantalizes us with a glimpse of a solution composed of [Match-to-SmartCard PKI and Biometric authentication](http://www.coresecuritypatterns.com/blogs/?p=262) - starring OpenSSO in "multi-factor authentication based Web SSO that uses on-card credentials (PIN + PKI + Biometrics) using PIV card." More details, please, Ramesh!
*   Finally, [John Willis](http://www.johnmwillis.com/)' [CloudDroplets #20 podcast](http://www.johnmwillis.com/droplets/clouddroplets-20-cry-baby-cry/) covers the '[OpenSSO in the Clouds](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/opensso_in_the_clouds)' presentation I gave this week at the AWSome Atlanta Meetup. Thanks again for the invitation to speak, John, I had a blast!

Well - that wraps things up for this week. [Don't forget to vote for OpenSSO in the SOA World Readers' Choice Awards](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/soa_world_readers_choice_awards)!!!
