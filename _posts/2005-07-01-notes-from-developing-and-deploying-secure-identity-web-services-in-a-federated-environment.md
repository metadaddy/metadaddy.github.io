Thanks to [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) of [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/) for [this report](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/archive/2005/06/securing_web_se.html) on my other JavaOne session. I particularly like the description "simply amazing and magic-like" ![](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/images/smileys/smile.gif)
