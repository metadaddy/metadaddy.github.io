The transcript for the recent [Sun Identity Management Experts Exchange](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=sun_identity_management_experts_exchange) is now [online](https://communications.sun.com/dialog/eearchive.do) (click on the PDF icon next to 'Drill into Sun Java System Identity Management'). This event was a real buzz - Chris LaPoint, Kevin LeMay and I answered questions on the Sun Identity Management product line from all comers live online. Thanks to all who participated!
