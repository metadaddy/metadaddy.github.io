As [Arun just blogged](http://blogs.sun.com/arungupta/entry/glassfish_family_in_readers_choice), SOA World magazine has just announced the finalists for its 2008 Readers' Choice Awards. [Sun Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.jsp)/[OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) is nominated for the '[Best Security Solution](http://www2.sys-con.com/java/readerschoice2004/2006open.cfm?rctype=readerschoicesoa2007&BType=Best%20Security%20Solution)' category. In fact, a whole bunch of Sun products and projects were nominated across several categories - [Arun has a list](http://blogs.sun.com/arungupta/entry/glassfish_family_in_readers_choice).

As Arun also mentions, it seems like SOA World haven't sorted out the voting process yet - the site still invites you to nominate products, even though nominations closed June 22, so you can't go vote for OpenSSO just yet. Watch this space for an update when voting starts.
