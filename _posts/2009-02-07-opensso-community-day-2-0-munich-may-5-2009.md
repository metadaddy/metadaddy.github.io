**You asked, we listened... the next OpenSSO Community Day is in Europe!**

After I announced the [NYC OpenSSO Community Day](http://blog.superpat.com/2009/01/27/opensso-community-day-nyc-march-17-2009/), one of the most frequently asked questions was "Can we do an OpenSSO community day near me?", with many requests coming from the other side of the Atlantic. So... we got together with our friends at [Kuppinger Cole](http://www.kuppingercole.com/) and are pleased to announce... **OpenSSO Community Day 2.0**!!!

Hosted by the [European Identity Conference 2009](https://www.id-conf.com/eic2009) at the [Deutsches Museum](http://www.nfadm.de/) in Munich, Germany, and sponsored by [Sun Microsystems](http://www.sun.com/), this is another opportunity for [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) contributors, deployers and users to come together in an informal '[unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)' setting.

Being an unconference, the only rigid item on the agenda will be to decide at 9am on the sessions for the rest of the day. You can show up and talk about any OpenSSO-related topic you like. Maybe you have an interesting deployment, a new extension or a nagging question - sessions can be discussions as much as presentations. Now, that doesn't mean that there need be zero preparation - if you have a session in mind, [go to the wiki](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/OpenSSO+Community+Day+-+Munich+-+May+5+2009) and add it there, so folks can get an idea of the likely content ahead of time. [We've already posted a few ideas](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/OpenSSO+Community+Day+-+Munich+-+May+5+2009).

All are welcome, attendance is free, and lunch will be provided. We'll likely adjourn to a nearby bar at the end of the day to continue the conversation :-)
