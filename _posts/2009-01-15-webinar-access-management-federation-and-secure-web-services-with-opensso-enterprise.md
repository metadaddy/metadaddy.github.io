The (unfortunately) irrepressible [Daniel Raskin](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/) and his [sometime co-conspirator](http://blog.superpat.com/2008/09/30/opensso-in-second-life/) [Jamie Nelson](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/accessmgmt.html) are presenting a webinar on [Access Management, Federation, and Secure Web Services with OpenSSO Enterprise](https://www2.sun.de/dct/forms/reg_us_0601_663_0.jsp) next Wednesday, January 21\. Unfortunately, this will be a 'regular' webinar (no [Second Life acrobatics](http://www.sun.com/emrkt/campaign_assets/secondlife/opensso.jsp) this time!), but [tune in anyway](https://www2.sun.de/dct/forms/reg_us_0601_663_0.jsp) for all the latest on [OpenSSO Enterprise](http://www.sun.com/software/products/opensso_enterprise/).
