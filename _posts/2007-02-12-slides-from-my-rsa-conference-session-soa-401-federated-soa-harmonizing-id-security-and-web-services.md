![RSA Conference logo](https://blog.superpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RSA_Conference.png){: .align-left}I just uploaded the slides from my RSA Conference presentation last week: [Federated SOA: Harmonizing ID Security and Web Services](http://blog.superpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/SOA-401-Patterson.pdf). A few words of explanation on the opening slides... [Sara Gates](http://blogs.sun.com/saragates/) was originally booked to present in this slot. [As you almost certainly already know](http://blogs.zdnet.com/digitalID/?p=76), Sara left Sun a little while ago, and I inherited her slot. So, my opening gimmick was to introduce myself as Sara and then say "Of course, I'm not Sara, you can see and hear that, but how could a Web service tell the difference?". It was spoilt a little on the day by the RSA Conference announcer introducing me as Pat Patterson, but I made the point that if I _had_ tried to introduce myself as Sara... Anyway, in the presentation, I start from the position of unprotected web service interactions, working through transport-layer security via TLS/SSL to point-to-point message-layer security to [Liberty Alliance](http://projectliberty.org/)'s [Identity Web Service Framework](http://projectliberty.org/index.php/liberty/specifications__1) (ID-WSF), pointing out the different properties of each level. The session was recorded - I'm not sure if the recording will be publicly available, but, if so, I'll update this entry with a URL when it goes online.
