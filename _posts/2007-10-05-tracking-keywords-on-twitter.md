I had to piece this together from several sources (including some great hints from [Mark Atwood](http://mark.atwood.name/)), so I consider it blogworthy...

A few days ago I tweeted (posted an update on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/)) that I was looking at [OAuth](http://oauth.net/). A few seconds later, Mark Atwood IM'd me: "Any questions about OAuth? I'm one of the spec authors". Wow. How did that happen?

It turns out that [you can now track keywords on Twitter](http://twitter.com/blog/2007/09/tracking-twitter.html). For some reason I thought you could only get this working via SMS, you can also do it on IM. Here's how...

*   You'll need an IM client, if you haven't already got one. I use [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com/). [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/) is also a fine choice.
*   Get an [AIM](http://www.aim.com/), [GTalk](http://www.google.com/talk/) or [Jabber](http://jabber.org) account, if you haven't already.
*   [Follow the instructions to tie your IM account to your Twitter account](http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=28).
*   Now just IM **track _something_** to Twitter and you'll get an IM whenever anyone uses that term (_something_ can be more than one word). I'm tracking OpenSSO, my Twittername - [metadaddy](http://twitter.com/metadaddy), and my real name.
