Back in December of last year, [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) and I co-wrote the article [Sun and Microsoft Interoperate for Web Authentication, Part 1](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/interoperability.html). In that article we examined how [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/)'s policy agents work with Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) to provide single sign-on and authorization in a heterogeneous environment. At the end of the piece, we promised further articles on integration with SharePoint Portal Server 2003 and Outlook Web Access in Microsoft Exchange 2003\.

Well, it's been a while, but the planets finally aligned for Robertis Tongbram, Access Manager policy agent engineer, and Marina to create the second article (deep breath): [Sun and Microsoft Interoperate for Web Authentication, Part 2 - Sun Java System Access Manager and SharePoint Portal Server 2003](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/sharepoint.html). The article works from the basics of authentication and authorization in SharePoint to configuring single sign-on between Access Manager and SharePoint via the policy agent. If you're wrestling with SharePoint, I recommend you [go take a look](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/sharepoint.html).
