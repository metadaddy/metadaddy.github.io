I realized that the About page here is broken (probably in some upgrade of [Roller](http://rollerweblogger.org/project/)), so here is some current information about me, your humble author. I've written it as an entry in the 'About Me' category so I can post updates, you can comment, whatever.

I'm Pat Patterson, a federation architect working on Sun's [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/), [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml) and [Sun Java System Federation Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/federation_mgr/index.xml). I'm British - born in England of Scottish parents and grew up in the <del>fair</del> concrete city of [Coventry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry). I've been working on internet security with Java since 1997, when I wrote my first ever piece of commercial Java code - an [ASN.1](http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/) library for decoding [X.509 certificates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509).

So, what do I actually do?

*   Much of my time is spent on [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/), particularly the mechanics of opening up what was a proprietary software product to be an open source project.
*   I'm driving a sub-project of OpenSSO - '[Lightbulb](https://lightbulb.dev.java.net/)' - the first fruit of which is a [SAML 2.0 service provider implementation in PHP](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/switching_on_the_lightbulb).
*   I participate in the [Liberty Alliance Project](http://projectliberty.org/) Technical Experts Group (TEG) as a representative of Sun Microsystems.
*   I regularly speak at events such as [Java One](http://sun.com/javaone), [Liberty Alliance Day](http://www.convention-info.net/lad2006/) and [Identity Open Space](http://ios.windley.com/wiki/IOSVan).
*   And finally, <del>maintaining my personality cult</del> blogging.
