You might have read [earlier](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/welcome_indira_another_access_manager) [posts](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/sun_opensso_am_bloggers) where I mentioned [Indira Thangasamy](http://blogs.sun.com/indira/) - one of our latest [Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml)/[Federation Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/federation_mgr/index.xml)/[OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/) bloggers. Well, Indira has been blogging up a storm of late, with [this entry on getting OpenSSO working with OpenDS](http://blogs.sun.com/indira/entry/opensso_with_opends_for_the) and, today, [a comprehensive guide to getting the whole open source stack of OpenDS/GlassFish/OpenSSO working](http://blogs.sun.com/indira/entry/solaris%7Copends%7Cglassfish%7Copensso_-_a_perfect_union).

This is great stuff - Indira lays the steps out with clear screenshots illustrating the way. Fantastic work, Indira - you're raising the bar for all of us!
