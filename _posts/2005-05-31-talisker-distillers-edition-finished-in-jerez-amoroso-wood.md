With an annoying cold on my chest, tonight seems like a night for Talisker - that most warming of single malts. I have the 'Distiller's Edition' - distilled in 1986 and finished in casks that previously contained Jerez Aromoso. Talisker is the Isle of Skye's only distillery, and has a reputation for fiery, peppery malts. The Distiller's Edition is mellowed by the sherry finish, but the fire is definitely still there. I'm afraid, due to my cold, I can't report on the 'nose', but from recollection, it has a nutty, toffee aroma. Tasting it, the toffee is definitely there, giving way to pepper with a hint of seaweed. The pepper continues in the finish with a salty seaside tang.  
If the regular Talisker is a bit much for you (are you listening, Ken?), this might be just your <strike>cup of tea</strike> glass of malt. Mmmm - I feel better already!
