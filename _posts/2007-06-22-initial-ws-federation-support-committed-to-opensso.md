The [WS-Federation](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsfed) service provider and configuration CLI code was committed into [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/) yesterday - [this PDF](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/GetAttachment?list=dev&msgId=1134012&attachId=1) gives some basic instructions on getting started with WS-Fed and OpenSSO. Note that this is just the initial drop of code - still to come is identity provider support.

Give it a whirl and send us feedback at dev(at)opensso.dev.java.net.
