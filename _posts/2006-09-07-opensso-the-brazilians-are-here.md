Wow - I just received an [email from Rodrigo Urubatan](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=22) on the [dev@opensso.dev.java.net](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=dev) mailing list:

> I have just wrote an step by step start up for OpenSSO in Portuguese. The link is [here](http://blog.urubatan.com.br/2006/09/07/opensso-soluo-para-gerenciamento-de-identidades-open-source/) Do not know if I`ll use it yet, but I have loved this piece of software :D

I'm blown away - we already have a truly _global_ OpenSSO community. I guess this is what [James Gosling](http://blogs.sun.com/jag/) refers to as '[the](http://blogs.sun.com/jag/entry/those_crazy_brazilians) [Brazilian](http://blogs.sun.com/jag/entry/fun_in_brazil) [effect](http://blogs.sun.com/jag/entry/brazialian_national_healthcare)'. (Actually, Google tells me that [Jonathan](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/) coined that phrase in [this blog posting](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/brazil), but you get the jist.)
