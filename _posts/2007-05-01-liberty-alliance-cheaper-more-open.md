Just back from the Liberty Alliance plenary meeting in Brussels, Belgium. [Lots of interesting](http://wiki.projectliberty.org/index.php/Concordia) [stuff afoot](http://connectid.blogspot.com/2007/04/openid-bootstrap-to-id-wsf.html), both in the plenary meeting itself and the associated [Identity Open Space (IOS) event](http://ios.windley.com/wiki/IOSBrussels).

One big news item - the economics of Liberty participation just changed, radically: effective May 1, individuals can join Liberty Alliance as associate ($100) or sponsor ($250) members. Fees have also been reduced for enterprises and other organizations - see the new [Membership Matrix (PDF)](http://projectliberty.org/index.php/liberty/content/download/3228/21552/file/Membership%20Matrix%20as%20of%201%20May%202007.pdf) for details.

Also, the [Technology Experts Group (TEG) mailing list is now publicly viewable](http://lists.projectliberty.org/pipermail/Publicly_viewable_members-only_lists/technology/). [Paul explains some of the rationale.](http://connectid.blogspot.com/2007/05/liberty-alliance-technology-list.html) TEG is the powerhouse of the Liberty Alliance (no offense to Public Policy, Business and Marketing or any of the other expert groups!), turning market requirements into specifications; this move makes that mechanism completely transparent.

Looks like the trend towards [openness and participation](http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/) is spreading!
