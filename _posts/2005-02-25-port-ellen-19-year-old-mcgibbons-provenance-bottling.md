I picked this bottle up some time ago at (I think) the whisky shop at Heathrow. It was distilled in spring 1982 and bottled in spring 2002 as 'over 19 years old'. Now this is a special whisky; Port Ellen closed in 1984 and is now partly demolished. The maltings survive, supplying malted barley to the remaining Islay distilleries, but the stills are gone forever.  
Pale gold in colour, with a slightly salty, slightly sweet nose, this is not a heavyweight Islay malt in the style of Ardbeg or Laphroiag. Smooth and sweet on the palate, the finish is long and strong - smoky, salty with a hint of that seaside iodine tang. I could drink a lot of this one...
