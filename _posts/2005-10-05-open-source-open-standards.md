[Robin Wilton](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/racingsnake) [astutely points out](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/comments/racingsnake?anchor=meanwhile_back_on_this_planet) that [Apache's TSIK incubator project](http://incubator.apache.org/tsik/index.html)'s [roadmap](http://incubator.apache.org/tsik/roadmap.html) is somewhat off the mark in its description of Infocard in relation to the [Liberty Alliance Project](http://www.projectliberty.org) [specifications](http://www.projectliberty.org/resources/specifications.php) (and others):

> Some of the initial ideas of TSIK is to implement WS-* standards as they are developed, in particular the ones related to implementation of a federated ID protocol such as [Microsoft's InfoCard](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwebsrv/html/identitymetasystem.asp). (There are other federated ID protocols, for example, [Liberty Alliance](http://www.projectliberty.org/), [Sxip networks](http://sxip.com/), [Identity Commons](http://www.identitycommons.net/), [LID NetMesh](http://lid.netmesh.org/), [Passel.org](http://www.passel.org/trac.cgi), but only InfoCard seems to be based on open web services standards.)

This does indeed seem to be a case of "[The World Turned Upside Down](http://www.contemplator.com/england/worldtur.html)". What I find most strange is that there is no mention in this list of the grandaddy of them all - [SAML](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security) - now in its [2.0 version](http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/index.php#samlv2.0) and as openly standardised as an open standard can be, at [OASIS](http://www.oasis-open.org/).  
Deeply puzzling...
