<span style="margin: 5px; float: right;">[![Huawei](http://blog.superpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/logo.gif)](http://www.huawei.com/)</span> I started work this morning at [Huawei](http://www.huawei.com/)'s Santa Clara office, specifically in the 'Virtual Data Center' team with [Geoff Arnold](http://speakingofclouds.com/). So far, the best description of what I'll be doing is in Geoff's blog entry - [Building a Team](http://speakingofclouds.com/?p=216).
