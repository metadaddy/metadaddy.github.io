[![](images/ScottNSteve.png){: .align-left}](http://www.sun.com/software/media/flash/demo_federation/index.html) My colleagues over in marketing (Hi Julie!) have done a great job reworking our Identity 'landing area' - [http://www.sun.com/identity](http://www.sun.com/identity). There's a bunch of new stuff there; my favourite is the '[What is Federation?](http://www.sun.com/software/media/flash/demo_federation/index.html)' Flash preso in the [Resources section](http://www.sun.com/emrkt/idmanagement/resources.jsp) - a slightly sideways look at what we mean when we say 'federation'. Highly recommended, even if you (think you) already know federation inside out.
