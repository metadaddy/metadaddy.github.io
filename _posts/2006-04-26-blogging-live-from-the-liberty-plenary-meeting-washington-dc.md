I'm sitting here in Liberty's Technology Expert Group (TEG) wearing my [I'm blogging this](http://www.thinkgeek.com/oreilly/tshirts/5eb7/) t-shirt. One of the TEG co-chairs actually asked if I really was blogging the meeting, given Liberty's rules on confidentiality (themselves freely available in the [Liberty Membership Kit](http://www.projectliberty.org/membership/agreements/mempack.zip)).

Well, yes, I am blogging the meeting ![](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/images/smileys/smile.gif)

I can tell you that Liberty is welcoming a number of new members to their first Plenary meeting, including Fulvens (a small UK consultancy) and [Credentica](http://www.credentica.com/), with whom you may be familiar from [earlier](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=is_liberty_panoptical) [postings](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=that_was_the_catalyst_that). We've covered a lot of ground over the past couple of days in TEG, syncing up with Liberty's Strong Auth Expert Group today for an interesting discussion on, uh, strong authentication.

Well - that's about all I can tell you for now. For more, go [join Liberty](http://www.projectliberty.org/membership/index.php) and come meet with us in Vancouver in July.
