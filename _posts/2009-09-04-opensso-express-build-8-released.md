[A few weeks ago, I blogged about the impending release of OpenSSO Express Build 8](opensso-express-build-8-and-opends-se-2-0); well, the [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) engineers have been hard at work since then, and [Express 8 was officially released yesterday](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ReadMsg?list=announce&msgNo=9).

Among the new features:

*   [One time password-based strong authentication](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/roadmap_preview_1x_password_w)
*   [Fedlet for .Net](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/opensso_enterprise_fedlet_for_net)
*   [MySQL user data store](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/Using+MySQL+as+the+User+Data+Store+in+OpenSSO+Express+8)
*   [First cut of the Entitlement Service](http://blogs.sun.com/docteger/entry/opensso_entitlements_service_overview)
*   Task flow for federation with SalesForce.com
*   [First look at the new IceFaces-based administration console](http://blogs.sun.com/docteger/entry/opensso_beta_administration_console)

Much more detail in the [OpenSSO Express 8 release notes](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/OpenSSO+Express+8+Release+Notes). If you're wondering just what an 'Express Build' of OpenSSO is, [the FAQ reveals all](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/Sun+OpenSSO+Express).
