It finally happened - I got a round tuit. The tuit in question was updating [Planet Identity](http://planetidentity.org/) to a more recent version of the Planet software - specifically, [Sam Ruby](http://www.intertwingly.net/)'s [Venus](http://www.intertwingly.net/code/venus/). There will be a bit of short term disruption as things settle down (I had to clear the feed cache), but the upside is that [Atom](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287) feeds are now properly supported - no more &lt;s and &gt;s in the feed. Hopefully ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)
