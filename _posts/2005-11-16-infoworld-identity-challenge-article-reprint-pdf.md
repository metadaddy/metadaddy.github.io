_I just got back from a month of business and vacation travel (Singapore, Disneyland, Tokyo), so I have a backlog of blog entries fermenting away. Here's the first..._

I [recently blogged](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=sun_identity_manager_comes_out) on Sun Java System Identity Manager's outstanding performance in [InfoWorld's Identity Challenge](http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/10/07/41FEidm_1.html?s=feature). We have now secured reprint rights for the [portion of the article covering Identity Manager](http://mediacast.sun.com/share/superpat/1-12921784-eprint-revised.pdf). Here are some choice quotes:

*   “… a level of reliability and maturity that’s rare for this segment”

Read it, print it out, wallpaper your spare room with it ![:-)](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/images/smileys/smile.gif ":-)")

Incidentally, there's an interesting correction at the end of the article:

> The Sun Java System Identity Manager 5.5 bundle includes Identity Manager, Access Manager, and Directory Server Enterprise Edition. Including software, support, and maintenance, it costs $50 per employee per year, or $135,000 per year for our 2,700-user test scenario. The text has been corrected.

Shame they don't seem to have updated the scores - it looks like Identity Manager would tie with or beat Novell with the corrected scoring...

**UPDATED 11/17/2005:** [Revised PDF](http://mediacast.sun.com/share/superpat/1-12921784-eprint-revised.pdf) from InfoWorld has correct pricing. Score for value still doesn't reflect correct price, though.
