[Unveiled in OpenSSO last year](http://blog.superpat.com/2008/06/03/from-the-trenches-virtual-federation-a-pioneering-way-for-exchanging-authentication/), virtual federation is a technique for integrating existing ('legacy') applications with federation protocols such as SAML 2.0, allowing them to interact across enterprise boundaries. Today at [Sun Developer Network's identity pages](http://developers.sun.com/identity/), Mike Hortobagyi, a solutions architect with [Brighton Consulting](http://bright1.com/) (and 'horto' on the [#opensso](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/OpenSSO+IRC+Channel) IRC channel), and [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/), who must be just about the hardest working writer at SDN, give [an overview of virtual federation and OpenSSO's Secure Attributes Exchange (SAE) component](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/virtual-federation.html). This is part one of a two part series based on Mike's experiences over the past few months working with a Canadian financial services provider setting up virtual federation with a series of Canadian banks, so it's the real deal!

You might also be interested to know that each Sun Developer network article now has a discussion section - I just kicked things off for Mike and Marina's article - [why don't you go read the article now and let them know what YOU think?](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/virtual-federation.html)
