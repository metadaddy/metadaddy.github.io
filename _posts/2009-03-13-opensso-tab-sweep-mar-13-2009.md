Lots of news over the last couple of weeks from the world of [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/). Events in New York, new Fedlet innovations and more; read on...

*   The [first OpenSSO Community Day](http://www.meetup.com/opensso/calendar/9588430/) fast approaches - next Tuesday, March 17 2009 at the NYU Kimmel Center in Greenwich Village, New York City. We're fully booked now, but there are still some folks on the 'maybe' list, so you can [sign up on the waiting list](http://www.meetup.com/opensso/calendar/9588430/) and bag a place if one of those maybes turns into a 'no'.
*   <span style="margin: 5px; float: left;">[![](http://blog.superpat.com/C1E_170x93_Speaking_v2.gif)](http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone/2009/east/)</span> Late-breaking news for next week - I'll be joining Java evangelist [Sang Shin](http://www.javapassion.com/) for his [Community One East](http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone/2009/east/) session "OpenSSO: Enterprise Security". We'll be presenting in Breakout Room 4 at 10:10am on Wednesday, March 18 2009\.
*   [One I mentioned over at The Aquarium last week](http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/opensso_release_schedule_published) - [we've posted the OpenSSO release schedule for the next year](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/Schedule). There's lots of detail on the features planned for the next few express builds of OpenSSO, as well as OpenSSO Enterprise 8.1, scheduled for March 2010\.
*   [Giuseppe Gennaro](http://blogs.sun.com/whalphin/), a recent hire into the OpenSSO engineering team, has [blogged about the long-awaited .Net version](http://blogs.sun.com/whalphin/entry/fedlet_for_net_preview) of our [Fedlet](http://tinyurl.com/fedlet). Like its Java cousin, the .Net Fedlet will easily federation-enable .Net applications via SAML 2.0\. If you're working with federation in .Net-land, keep an eye on Giuseppe!
*   Super Sun SE [Jeff Bounds](http://blogs.sun.com/bounds/) doesn't blog often, but when he does, it's all goodness. His most recent entry is [OpenSSO Authentication with Active Directory (Part 1)](http://blogs.sun.com/bounds/entry/opensso_authentication_with_active_directory), expanding on the OpenSSO documentation to provide a step-by-step tutorial for using OpenSSO with AD, chock-full of screenshots. More great stuff for the Microsoft-oriented.
*   Hot on the heels of [my recent entry pointing out the interaction between SAML and XACML](xacml-and-saml-a-match-made-in-2005), Steven Jarosz, another star Sun SE, has [started to document some interesting ways of deploying the Fedlet](http://wikis.sun.com/display/myLabNotes/Fedlet+Enhancments), the first being a XACML policy enforcement point (PDP). People sometime ask me "How does open source make a difference in identity at Sun?" - this is a perfect example - these innovative applications would be an order of magnitude more difficult, if not impossible, without the source code freely available.
*   Our cousins in [Sun Identity Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/identity_mgr/)-land [just announced](http://blogs.sun.com/identityconnectors/entry/project_identity_connector_is_live) [Identity Connectors](https://identityconnectors.dev.java.net/), an open source project providing a [framework](https://identityconnectors.dev.java.net/downloads.html#Framework) and [toolkit](https://identityconnectors.dev.java.net/Java_Toolkit.html) for creating Identity Manager connectors, as well as [8 connector bundles](https://identityconnectors.dev.java.net/downloads.html#Bundles) covering systems from AD to DB2 to VMS, with Google Apps coming soon. The [Identity Connectors blog](http://blogs.sun.com/identityconnectors/) is the place to watch for more info.

That wraps things up for this week. Don't forget, if you're planning to attend the [European Identity Conference 2009](https://www.id-conf.com/eic2009) in May, the [second OpenSSO Community Day](http://www.meetup.com/opensso/calendar/9690413/) will be there on the Tuesday, May 5 2009\. [Register at Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/opensso/calendar/9690413/) and you can pick up a discount code for 20% off the cost of your EIC registration. Bargain!
