<span style="margin: 5px; float: right;">[![](http://blog.superpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/1000-250px.png)](http://opensso.org/)</span> A celebration this week and events over the next month in the world of [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/)... Â 

*   OpenSSO is 1000 members strong! Many more than 1000 people have downloaded OpenSSO (in fact, there are well over 1000 downloads every month), but 1000 people have [registered at opensso.dev.java.net](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest) to be able to participate in the mailing lists and forums, and to be able to file and track issues. All I can say is... wow!
*   If you're going to the [RSA Conference](http://www.rsaconference.com/2009/us) next week at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, don't miss [The Smoking Monkey](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/) and I presenting [A Pragmatic Approach to Building Identity Management for the Enterprise](https://cm.rsaconference.com/US09/catalog/profile.do?SESSION_ID=3920&form=searchform&ts=1240114495115). We'll be in the Briefing Center on Wednesday April 22, 2009 at 5:30pm. [More details and a qualification code for a FREE Expo pass [PDF]](http://blog.superpat.com/SunRSAInvite.pdf).
*   If, on the other hand, you're planning to take in the [MySQL Conference](http://www.mysqlconf.com/mysql2009/) next week, at the Santa Clara Convention Center, the OpenSSO team's very own Sean Brydon will be moderating a 'birds of a feather' (BoF) session - [Using the OpenSSO Project and MySQL to Secure Users and Applications](http://www.mysqlconf.com/mysql2009/public/schedule/detail/8918) - at 8:30pm on Tuesday April 21st, 2009 in Ballroom C. If you're thinking of coming, but hadn't planned to attend the MySQL Conference, you might be interested to know that a $25 Exhibit Hall Only Pass will get you into all the BoF's. [Register Here](https://en.oreilly.com/mysql2009/public/register).
*   A little bit further out, [registration is still open for the second OpenSSO Community Day](http://www.meetup.com/opensso/calendar/9690413/), to be held at the Forum am Deutschen Museum in Munich (hosted by the [European Identity Conference 2009](https://www.id-conf.com/eic2009)) on Tuesday May 5th 2009\. The first Community Day last month in New York City was a great success, with [nine sessions on a variety of identity-related topics](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/OpenSSO+Community+Day+-+NYC+-+March+17+2009). We'll be using the 'unconference' format again in Munich, so come along and join in!
*   At the European Identity Conference proper, I'll be participating in the [Realigning AuthZ and Access Control with the Business](https://www.id-conf.com/sessions/517) panel, alongside [Bavo De Ridder](http://blog.bavoderidder.com/) (De Ridder Consulting), John Aisien (Oracle), [Kim Cameron](http://www.identityblog.com/) (Microsoft), Keith Grayson (SAP) and Finn Frisch (Axiomatics), at 11:30am on Wednesday May 6th, 2009\. If you're staying in Munich for the entire week, be sure to catch Sun's [Dr. Steffo Weber](http://blogs.sun.com/steffo/) and Abdi Mohammadi, along with [Vittorio Bertocci](http://blogs.msdn.com/vbertocci/) of Microsoft for [Hands-On SOA and Web Security with the Geneva Framework and with OpenSSO](https://www.id-conf.com/sessions/581).
*   Alternatively, later that same week are [Sun Microsystems' Northern Europe Open IAM User days](http://be.sun.com/sunnews/events/2009/openiamdays/index.jsp). Spanning Thursday and Friday May 7th-8th, 2009, the user days will be held at [Sun's Belgian office](http://be.sun.com/aboutsun/location/) at Zaventem, just east of Brussels. I'll be speaking on Thursday, when we'll be focusing on [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) and [OpenDS](http://opends.org/), while Friday will be more oriented towards [Sun Identity Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/identity_mgr/index.xml) and [Sun Role Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/rolemanager/index.xml). [Register now](https://dct.sun.com/dct/forms/reg_be_1604_301_0.jsp) for what promises to be a fascinating couple of days.

So - there you have it - a packed few weeks in OpenSSO-land, and evidence that the OpenSSO community is as active IRL (in real life) as [on IRC](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/OpenSSO+IRC+Channel) (Internet relay chat) :-)
