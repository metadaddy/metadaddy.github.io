Thanks to Dave Kearns' [IdM News](http://idmjournal.com/news.html) page for the pointer to an [interview](http://www.esj.com/Security/article.aspx?EditorialsID=1511) with [Trustgenix](http://www.trustgenix.com/)'s Atul Tulshibagwale on the subject of Identity Web Services standards and specifications. Atul gives a good high level overview of SAML, Liberty and WS-Federation. One interesting comparison he draws is between the technology-consumer focus of Liberty and the vendor-centric approach of WS-* - I guess SAML falls somewhere in the middle. Having participated in Liberty's Technical Expert Group, the presence of tech-consumer companies such as AOL and France Telecom (just the first two names that spring to mind) provides an essential counterbalance to the likes of ourselves and IBM. For me, this is what gives the Liberty Alliance Project its unique relevance.
