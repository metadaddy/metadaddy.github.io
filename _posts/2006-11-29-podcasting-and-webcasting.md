It's been quite a week already and it's only Wednesday night! [Yesterday, I was interviewed by Aldo Casta√±eda](http://stodid.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=156315) for '[The Story of Digital Identity](http://www.stodid.com/)' - Aldo's regular podcast. The conversation centered on [Project Lightbulb](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/switching_on_the_lightbulb) (a sub-project of [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/)) - the PHP implementation of SAML 2.0\. We covered a lot of ground, looking at the motivation behind Lightbulb and what I'm working on right now - figuring out how we can bring together some aspects of [OpenID](http://openid.net/) with [SAML 2.0](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security#samlv20). There are some interesting synergies here, and I'm looking forward to talking about them at [IIW2006b](http://www.windley.com/events/iiw2006b/announcement) next week in Mountain View. If you're not too interested in digital identity, you can always skip to about 47"50' to hear all about single malt Scotch whisky ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)

This was my first podcast experience and a lot of fun it was, much less intense than a webcast (no slides!). Aldo is doing a great job, and I felt quite honored to be a part of '[STODID](http://www.stodid.com/)'. This series of podcasts really is required listening if you want to keep up with what's going on in digital identity.

By the way, you'll need iTunes or Quicktime to play the podcast. I didn't have any luck with Windows Media Player or RealPlayer. Other players might also work - feel free to leave a comment.

Today's event was a webcast for the [Liberty Alliance](http://projectliberty.org), again focusing on Project Lightbulb, but this time with slides and a demo. In the demo I show how to SAML 2.0 enable a simple PHP application by dragging in the Lightbulb files and editing 4 PHP scripts. I fall off the high wire one time ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/surprised.gif), but recover quite gracefully ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)

[The webcast is archived](http://projectliberty.org/index.php/liberty/resource_center/presentations) (you might need to scroll down a bit - look for 'Open Source Identity for the Web 2.0 Era'), but you have to [download the Webex player](http://www.webex.com/lp/player/download.html) to watch it.

I wonder what the rest of the week will bring...
