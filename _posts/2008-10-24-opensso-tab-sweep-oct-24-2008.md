Wow! [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) is **HOT** right now...

*   First up this week is [MarkMail](http://markmail.org/). [I've written before](http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/opensso_mail_traffic_a_healthy) about the insights we're getting into the OpenSSO community from MarkMail, well, I took a look the other day, and [we've already had significantly more mail on the OpenSSO Users list this month than any past month in its entirety](http://markmail.org/search/?q=list%3Anet.java.dev.opensso.users). Must be something to do with that [little event we had at the end of September](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/opensso_enterprise_8_0_launch)...
*   The [GlassFish](http://glassfish.org/) source code has been browsable from [Fisheye](http://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/) [for some time](http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/navigating_through_the_glassfish_source). Well, now those good folks at [Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com/) have turned their lens on OpenSSO - [take a look at the OpenSSO source through Fisheye](http://fisheye5.atlassian.com/browse/opensso).
*   [Google Alerts](http://www.google.com/alerts) is a great tool for tracking activity related to OpenSSO - one site that it picked up is [Open School Systems](http://www.openschoolsystems.com/) - a test lab for multiple open source initiatives related to K-12 school information systems and data exchange. According to [their news page](http://www.openschoolsystems.com/main/viewNews.do), they have selected OpenSSO as their solution for federation, single sign-on and identity management. It'll be interesting to see what they come up with.
*   [Satoshi Moriya](http://blogs.sun.com/moriya/), a Sun solution architect in Japan, has posted a [nice diagram tracing the evolution of OpenSSO](http://blogs.sun.com/moriya/entry/opensso_enterprise) ([Google translation to English](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.sun.com%2Fmoriya%2Fentry%2Fopensso_enterprise&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&sl=ja&tl=en)). Hopefully we can keep the same product name for at least the next three releases!
*   Speaking of Japan, I'll be speaking _in_ Japan next month, at the [Liberty Alliance Day 2008](http://www.event-web.jp/LAD2008/). The event is on Friday November 7th at [BelleSalle Kudan](http://www.bellesalle.co.jp/bs_kudan/); my session is at 16:20 - [OpenSSO â€“ selling Open Source Identity](http://www.event-web.jp/LAD2008/abst04.html). I'll be looking at how we open sourced Sun Access Manager, built a community around it and developed [OpenSSO Enterprise 8.0](http://www.sun.com/openssoenterprise). In particular, I'll be looking at some of the federation-related innovation in '8.0, including, of course, the [Fedlet](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/the_fedlet_has_arrived_check).
*   Finally, another find from Google Alerts: [Implementing Web Access Management at the University of Guelph](http://connect.educause.edu/Library/Abstract/ImplementingWebAccessMana/47527?time=1224871312) (in Ontario, Canada) - a poster presentation from the [EDUCAUSE 2008](http://net.educause.edu/e08) conference. The PDF is worth downloading and printing out as big as you can manage - there's a lot of practical information on deploying OpenSSO (and Shibboleth).

Finally, OpenSSO is coming to the [Stories](http://blogs.sun.com/stories/) blog - our first OpenSSO adoption story will run on Monday and will feature... well, you'll have to go look on Monday, or [subscribe to Stories](http://blogs.sun.com/stories/feed/entries/atom) ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)
