[Via Tatsuo Kudo](http://blogs.sun.com/tkudo/entry/sun_idm_is_strong_positve) - [Gartner](http://gartner.com/) recently published their latest [vendor rating for Sun](http://mediaproducts.gartner.com/reprints/sunmicrosystems/article3/article3.html). The overall picture is, well, sunny, if you'll pardon the pun, but I'm _particularly_ pleased with their ratings in the areas of Identity and Access Management and Open Source - 'Strong Positive'<sup>*</sup> for both, which means that [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) and [OpenDS](http://opends.org/) must be doubly blessed :-)

* _Strong Positive: Is viewed as a provider of strategic products, services or solutions:_

_*   Customers: Continue with planned investments.*   Potential customers: Consider this vendor a strong choice for strategic investments._
