I occasionally [write](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=mobile_operator_federation_web_services) [about](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=don_bowen_directory_fan_atic) [the](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=sun_java_system_directory_server#comment2) [great](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=mark_dixon_on_the_idenity) [people](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=another_new_voice_in_the) I work with here at Sun. If I ever need to know anything about [Directory Server](http://www.sun.com/software/products/directory_srvr_ee/index.xml), [Solaris](http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/) or [Linux](http://www.linux.org/) I drop an email to Neil Wilson, Directory guru. Neil [recently started blogging](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/DirectoryManager) - if you manage a Directory Server deployment then you _need_ to be reading this. Even if you don't, it's fascinating stuff. Neil writes with a rare combination of lucidity and technical detail. Highly recommended!
