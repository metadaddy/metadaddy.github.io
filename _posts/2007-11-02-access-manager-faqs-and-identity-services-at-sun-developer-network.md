It's been a busy couple of weeks, what with a trip to Tokyo, a [typhoon](http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7008967866) on the day I flew out, an [earthquake](http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Quakes/nc40204628.html) at home and the usual backlog of 1000 emails that follows any trip away from the office, so please excuse the recent dearth of blog entries!

On returning, I was pleased to see [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/)'s [identity pages](http://developers.sun.com/identity/) have continued their expansion. The latest additions are:

*   An [Access Manager/Federation Manager FAQ area](http://developers.sun.com/identity/overview/faq/index.jsp), with general FAQs and specific lists for [the admin console](http://developers.sun.com/identity/overview/faq/adminconsole.jsp), [authentication](http://developers.sun.com/identity/overview/faq/authentication.jsp) and [single sign-on/sessions](http://developers.sun.com/identity/overview/faq/sso.jsp).
*   [Aravindan](http://blogs.sun.com/aravind/) and [Marina](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) have written an article on [authentication with identity services](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/id-svcs.html) - the first of a series of articles on securing apps with identity services. In this context, identity services refers to a set of simple web services we are implementing to provide access to authentication, authorization and other related services via SOAP or REST.

Kudos to Marina and Aravindan for their tireless work on the [Sun Developer Network identity pages](http://developers.sun.com/identity/) - if you're working with Sun Java System Access Manager and related products, you should definitely [subscribe to the feed ![](http://blog.superpat.com/feed-icon16x16.png)](http://www.sun.com/rss/identity.xml).
