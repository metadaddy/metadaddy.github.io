A couple of folks (Hi [Eve](http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog), [Ash](http://identityman.blogspot.com/)!) pinged me over the past couple of days to report problems with [Planet Identity](http://planetidentity.org/) - specifically, the site was up, but hadn't aggregated any new posts since January 9th. It looks like the machine that hosts it (courtesy of [Stephen Lau](http://whacked.net/) - my continued thanks for his generosity!) got an OS upgrade that weekend, and my cron job was dropped in the transition. A quick kick, and all is running fine now. Thanks, Eve and Ash for the heads up, and [all the best at Forrester, Eve](http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/2011/01/16/ch-ch-ch-ch-changes/)!
