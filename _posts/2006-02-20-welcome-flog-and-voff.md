It was Tom's fourth birthday soon after Christmas. One of his friends gave him a [Planet Frog](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000062VU0/superpatterns-20) habitat - pictured. We sent off for the live tadpoles (Leopard Frog tadpoles, apparently), put them in the habitat with spring water and we're now feeding them regularly, waiting excitedly for any sign of legs. I'll keep you posted...
