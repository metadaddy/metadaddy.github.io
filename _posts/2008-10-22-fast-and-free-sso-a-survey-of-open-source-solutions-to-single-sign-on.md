Chatting in the [OpenSSO IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/opensso) today about [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) versus a range of other open source single sign-on projects, I was passed a link to [Fast and Free SSO: A Survey of Open-Source Solutions to Single Sign-On [PDF]](http://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/2007/pdf/TS-4604.pdf) - a presentation from JavaOne 2007\. Amazing - I had no idea! I was at JavaOne 2007 and somehow missed this. While it's obviously a little out of date, Craig Dickson and Naveen Nallannagari of Behr (the paint people) do a great job of surveying the open source SSO landscape. Well worth a look if you're in the market for open source SSO - [go read the paper](http://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/2007/pdf/TS-4604.pdf), then visit [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) for all your open source single-sign on needs ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)
