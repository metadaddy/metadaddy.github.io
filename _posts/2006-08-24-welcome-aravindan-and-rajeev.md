If you've been watching [blogs.sun.com](http://blogs.sun.com/) carefully over the past few days, you'll have noticed new blogs popping up from [Aravindan Ranganathan](http://blogs.sun.com/aravind) and [Rajeev Angal](http://blogs.sun.com/rangal). Aravindan and Rajeev are fellow architects on the Access Manager/Federation Manager team - you might have read [this interview](http://blog.superpat.com/2006/03/30/transcending-boundaries-with-federated-identity/) that Rajeev did for Sun's Inner Circle newsletter a little while ago.

Definitely blogs to watch if you are interested in [Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml), [Federation Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/federation_mgr/index.xml) and [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/). I'm happy to admit that Aravindan and Rajeev know the inner workings of that code _much_ better than I do!

Welcome, Aravindan and Rajeev!
