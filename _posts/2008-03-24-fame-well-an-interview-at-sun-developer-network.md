_From the shameless self-promotion dept..._

Hot on the heels of [her interview with Jamie last week](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/accessmgmt.html), [Marina](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/)'s [latest subject is... me!](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/opensso.html)

Sadly, my suggested title of "Sun's Rising Identity Superstar" was rejected in favor of the far less exciting "[OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/), a Thriving Community". Oh well...
