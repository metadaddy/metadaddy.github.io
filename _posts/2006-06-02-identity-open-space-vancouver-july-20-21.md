[![](http://iiw.windley.com/images/0/09/IOS2new.jpg){: .align-left}](http://iiw.windley.com/wiki/IdentityOpenSpace) You might have already [seen](http://www.identitywoman.net/?p=344) [some](http://connectid.blogspot.com/2006/06/iiw-lap.html) [blog](http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/archives/2006/06/01/celebrity-deathmatch/) [traffic](http://netmesh.info/jernst/2006/06/02#un-liberty-2006-07) on the [Identity Open Space event](http://iiw.windley.com/wiki/IdentityOpenSpace) coming up in Vancouver, July 20-21, jointly produced by the [Internet Identity Workshop](http://iiw.windley.com/wiki/Workshop2006) (IIW) folks and the [Liberty Alliance Project](http://projectliberty.org/).

This is cool (well, cool in a techie/geeky way ![](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/images/smileys/smile.gif)), on so many levels:

*   It gives folks who have been working independently on similar problems a chance to meet and get their heads together in a pretty informal setting.
*   All Identity Open Space attendees are invited to attend the Vancouver Liberty members' meeting, which immediately precedes IOS.
*   It's an opportunity to drive more convergence in digital identity, and convergence is good.

I sincerely hope Microsoft (active participants in [previous IIW events](http://www.identityblog.com/?p=438)) participate again here; as [Kim says](http://www.identityblog.com/?p=460) "I see you Liberty folks as allies in getting an identity metasystem done". I certainly count Kim as an ally in making the world safe for identity - I've been working with the identity folks at Microsoft for [some time now](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=sun_microsoft_press_conference). We showed [Infocard on stage at JavaOne](http://www.identityblog.com/?p=457) (another flock of pigs just flew past my window, by the way) and I've recently been working on some [WS-Federation integration with ADFS](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=customer_sabotage_just_what_you).

It's like a cake mix starting to come together - an exciting time to be working in identity.

[Register for the event here](https://www.projectliberty.org/scripts/ID_OpenSpace.asp) - see you in Vancouver!
