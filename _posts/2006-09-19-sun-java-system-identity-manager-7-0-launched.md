You might have already seen the news that [Identity Manager 7.0](http://www.sun.com/software/products/identity_mgr/index.jsp) was announced last week at [Digital ID World](http://conference.digitalidworld.com/2006/). As [Mark](http://blogs.sun.com/identity/entry/1_man_200_women_sun), [Bob](http://blogs.sun.com/ontherecord/entry/another_first_for_sun_converged) and [others](http://blogs.sun.com/SDNChannel/entry/identity_manager_7_0_just) have already given you the scoop on this, I'll confine myself here to covering the deltas from the last version (Identity Manager 6 2005Q4):

*   Integrated audit capabilities (previously provided via Identity Auditor).
*   High-throughput extranet provisioning capabilities (previously provided via Identity Manager Service Provider Edition).
*   Policy-based 'Periodic Access Review' (PAR) - 'who has access to what'.
*   Business Process Editor (BPE) rewritten as a [NetBeans](http://www.netbeans.org/) plugin.
*   A whole slew of tweaks, fixes and enhancements.
*   New [Advanced Deployment](http://www.sun.com/training/catalog/courses/IDM-4484.xml) training course - _UPDATE - this course is not specific to Identity Manager 7.0 - it covers advanced topics relevant to IDM 5.5 and above._

So - if you've been looking for the industry leading identity provisioning, _and auditing_, solution [look no further](http://www.sun.com/software/products/identity_mgr/index.jsp).
