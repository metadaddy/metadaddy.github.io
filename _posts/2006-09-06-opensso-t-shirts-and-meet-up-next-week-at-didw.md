We'll be having an [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/) meet up next week at the [Digital ID World Conference](http://conference.digitalidworld.com/2006/) at the [Santa Clara Marriott](http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/SJCGA). We'll meet at the Sun booth (#300, located at the front of the exhibit hall) at 6pm on Monday September 11th. Anyone registered on the OpenSSO project is welcome. After t-shirt distribution (see below) we'll adjourn to the nearest bar.

We'll also be giving away t-shirts (photo to follow - they're arriving today) to OpenSSO participants (hint - [sign up here!](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest)) throughout DIDW. Just come to the Sun booth, log in to the [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/) site to demonstrate your bona fides and claim your shirt.

See you next week!
