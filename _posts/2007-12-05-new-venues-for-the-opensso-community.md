We've been busy over the past couple of weeks, creating new venues for the OpenSSO community:

*   [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) has a new vanity URL - opensso.org (thanks, [Paul](http://www.linkedin.com/in/pbryan)!)
*   [OpenSSO Facebook Group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=8866085604)
*   [OpenSSO LinkedIn Group](http://www.linkedin.com/e/gis/44614/60041805DABC) (thanks again, Paul!)
*   [OpenSSO Cafepress Store](http://www.cafepress.com/opensso) (btw - the margin on the store is zero - you're getting all these tastefully branded goodies at cost).

I'm not sure how the Facebook group will work out - it's partly a venue for informal discussion of OpenSSO, partly promotion for the project, partly an opportunity to network with other OpenSSO-folk. I started it by inviting a bunch of my friends, but there are now folks there that I've never heard of. I guess that means it's working ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)
