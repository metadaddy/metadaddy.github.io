<span class="snap_nopreview" style="margin: 5px; float: right;">[![](http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NA7K3PTBL._AA200_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005O3VC/superpatterns-20)</span> The [Burton Group](http://www.burtongroup.com/)'s [Catalyst](http://catalyst.burtongroup.com/) conference is _always_ great value - insightful analysis from the Burton crew, customer case studies and last, but certainly not least, [vendor hospitality suites](http://catalyst.burtongroup.com/NA07/hospitality_vendors.htm). Our superstar marketeer [Bianca Botello](http://blogs.sun.com/idmbuzz/) always does a fantastic job on Sun's suite - last year's theme was a superhero-filled [Identity City](a-catalyst-with-a-difference-this-year); 2005 saw an [Identity Mission](that-was-the-catalyst-that-was) into space. This year it's 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' - complete with our CEO, president and star blogger 'King' [Jonathan Schwartz](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/). Come and quaff ale at Sun's hospitality suite in the Hilton San Francisco's California Room on Thursday, June 28 from 6 to 9:30pm. [**Sign up**](https://register.burtongroup.com/CatalystNA2007/HospitalitySuites/) for a hospitality suite badge with promo code: **hsgsun**. While we're on the Holy Grail theme... It's a little known fact that my older brother, George Patterson, was an extra in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. A couple of years ago I bought the DVD and captured the relevant screens. Here's George dancing in the wedding scene (he's the tall guy with red hair), about to be slaughtered by John Cleese: [![](images/Geordie1_sm.jpg)](images/Geordie1.jpg) And a very cool close-up, post-slaughter: [![](images/Geordie2_sm.jpg)](images/Geordie2.jpg) A more recent pic: ![](images/Geordie3.jpg) As far as I know, George has had zero presence on the web. Until today :-)
