Patrick Harding of [Ping Identity](http://www.pingidentity.com/) has written [an article on SAML 2.0](http://www.networkworld.com/news/tech/2005/120505techupdate.html) for [Network World](http://www.networkworld.com/). It's a useful resource, describing both the SAML 2.0 specifications (at a high level) and the convergence of standards and specs that led to them. However, it's a little strange that Patrick makes no mention of WS-Federation, especially since Ping support WS-Federation in a number of their products.  
Why so coy, Patrick???
