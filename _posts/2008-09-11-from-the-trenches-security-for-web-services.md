Over at [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/) today, [Sidharth Mishra](http://blogs.sun.com/sid) talks to [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) about [Security for Web Services](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/webservices.html). It's an interesting, high-level discussion, covering both the motivations for securing Web services and some of the standards and technology in the area. In particular, there's a useful explanation of the role of the Security Token Service (STS) in brokering trust between Web service consumers and providers.

Get yourself a nice cup of tea (or, if you must, coffee ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/wink.gif)) and [give it a read](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/webservices.html).
