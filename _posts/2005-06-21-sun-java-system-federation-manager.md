I'll update the above list as more come in.  
So what, exactly, is Federation Manager? Well, it's the SAML and Liberty technology that has been in [Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml) for the past two or three years, built into a new product specifically designed for the service provider. Doesn't Access Manager already support service providers? Well, yes, it does, and it will continue to do so. FM trades-off some of Access Manager's more advanced features in favour of ease of use when federation-enabling service providers.  
More information to come over the next few days...
