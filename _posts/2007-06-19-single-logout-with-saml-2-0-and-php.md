Back in February, [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) and I co-wrote an [article on the OpenSSO SAML 2.0 PHP Extension](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/lightbulb.html), or Lightbulb, as it was then known. The sequel to that article - [Single Logout: A Demo](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/single-logout.html) just went live at [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/): Marina and I provide an update on Project Lightbulb's evolution into an [OpenSSO Extension](https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/extensions/) as well as a look at circles of trust and single logout in [SAML 2.0](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security#samlv20). As before, we look at a simple example message flow, then delve down into the PHP code to see how it all works.
