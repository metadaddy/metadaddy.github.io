I went to the launch of [OpenSSO Enterprise 8.0](http://www.sun.com/software/products/opensso_enterprise/) ([press release](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-09/sunflash.20080930.1.xml)) this morning in Second Life, hosted by none other than the [IdentiCat](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/wanted_identicat_1_000_000) - [Daniel Raskin](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/), and my boss, director of engineering for OpenSSO - [Jamie Nelson](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/accessmgmt.html). It was definitely a different experience from a traditional webinar - there was audio and slides, but somehow it was more immersive, sitting in the hall with the other attendees. Some technical glitches, but, all in all, a great event.

_(Confession - the image (click on it for a [larger version](http://blog.superpat.com/OpenSSOSecondLife.png)) is a composite - when that slide was up, Daniel was off flying somewhere, and when he was sitting down, I just had a gray screen where the slide should have been)._

_UPDATE - if you missed the Second Life event, you can [catch the replay!](http://www.sun.com/emrkt/campaign_assets/secondlife/opensso.jsp)_
