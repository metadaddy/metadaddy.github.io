The other day, I blogged about [Openings in the OpenSSO QA Team](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/openings_in_the_opensso_qa), under [Indira Thangasamy](http://blogs.sun.com/indira/). Well, this week it's Indira's turn in the spotlight over at the [Sun Developer Network Identity pages](http://developers.sun.com/identity/) - talking with [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) about [Quality Assurance on OpenSSO](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/qa.html). Indira talks about how we are automating QA on [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) and building quality into the software right through the development process. It's a fascinating look at an oft-neglected area of software development, so make yourself a cup of tea, [settle down to read it](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/qa.html) then [apply for one of the openings on Indira's team](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/openings_in_the_opensso_qa).
