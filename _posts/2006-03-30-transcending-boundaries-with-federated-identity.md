![](http://www.sun.com/emrkt/innercircle/newsletter/im/0306rajeevangal.jpg){: .align-left} If you're an 'information technology leader' then you're probably already subscribed to Sun's [Inner Circle](http://www.sun.com/innercircle/) newsletter, so you've probably already read '[Transcending Boundaries with Federated Identity](http://www.sun.com/emrkt/innercircle/newsletter/0306cto.html)' - an interview with my fellow architect, Rajeev Angal.

Rajeev presents a thorough grounding in federated identity - what it is, why you should care and how to get started. If you're trying to get a grip on what federation is all about, this is a great place to start.

By the way, there seems to be a glitch with the feedback form at the bottom of the article. If you'd like to comment, then please do so here and I'll ensure it gets back to Rajeev and the Inner Circle crew.
