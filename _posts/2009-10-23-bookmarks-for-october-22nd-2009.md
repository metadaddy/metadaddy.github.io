These are my links for October 22nd 2009:

*   [19 Ways to Build Physical Security into a Data Center](http://www.csoonline.com/article/220665/19_Ways_to_Build_Physical_Security_into_a_Data_Center) - Quite old now (2005), but still very relevant. It doesn't matter how many layers of security you have in the cloud infrastructure software if you allow unauthorized access to the hardware!
*   [Cloud Cube Model: Selecting Cloud Formations for Secure Collaboration](http://www.opengroup.org/jericho/cloud_cube_model_v1.0.pdf) - From the Jericho Forum - a model for organizing cloud computing into four dimensions - so it really should be a hypercube :-)
*   [Cloud Standards Wiki](http://cloud-standards.org/) - Not sure who actually runs this, but it's a useful collection of links relating to cloud standards
*   [Daoli Project](http://www.daoliproject.org/) - Interesting - a project to leverage Trusted Computing in the Cloud - the hypervisor becomes part of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
