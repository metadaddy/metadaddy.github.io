These are my links for October 1st 2009:

*   [Microsoft's grinning robots or the Brotherhood of the Mac. Which is worse?](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/sep/28/charlie-brooker-microsoft-mac-windows) - Entertaining rant from Charlie Booker at The Guardian on the 'shitasmic' Windows 7 Launch Party video.
*   [brain aided dancing: a mix for the MIGHTY! designers republic](http://www.noiseheatpower.com/brain_aided_dancing.htm) - A one-hour-plus mix of tracks with one thing in common - cover artwork by the Designers Republic. I must have about half the tracks here - Chakk, Age of Chance, Krush, The Orb, Pulp and, of course, the fabulous Pop Will Eat Itself. Marvelous!
