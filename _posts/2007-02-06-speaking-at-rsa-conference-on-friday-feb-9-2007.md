I'll be speaking at the RSA Conference on Friday at 9am in Gold Room 310 on [Federated SOA: Harmonizing ID Security and Web Services](https://cm.rsaconference.com/US07/catalog/profile.do?SESSION_ID=1907). I'll be looking at the role of identity in Web services, from the very basics of transport-level security to the [Liberty Alliance](http://projectliberty.org/)'s [Identity Web Services Framework](http://projectliberty.org/index.php/liberty/specifications__1) (ID-WSF), and how these are realized in [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/) and [Sun Java System Federation Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/federation_mgr/). Do come along and say "Hi!"
