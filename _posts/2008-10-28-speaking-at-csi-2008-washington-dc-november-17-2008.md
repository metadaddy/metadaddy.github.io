The good people at the [Computer Security Institute](http://www.gocsi.com/) have invited me to speak at their [CSI 2008](http://www.csiannual.com/) conference as part of an [Identity 'summit panel'](https://www.cmpevents.com/CSI35/a.asp?option=C&V=11&SessID=7527) considering topics in the field of identity, federation and security. Jim Nelson of New Mexico State University is moderating the panel, with John Petze of [Privaris](http://www.privaris.com/), Robert Richardson of the Computer Security Institute and [Pamela Dingle](http://eternaloptimist.wordpress.com/) of [Nulli Secundus](http://www.nulli.com/) also speaking. If you have a taste for the CardSpacey side of digital identity, Pamela's name will be very familiar from her work at [OSIS](http://osis.idcommons.net/).

Although the conference site lists the summit as running from 11:00am - 5:00pm on Monday, November 17th, 2008, my understanding is that the panel sessions will run 11am-noon, 1:45pm-2:45pm, and 4pm-5pm. Come along and see where the conversation takes us!
