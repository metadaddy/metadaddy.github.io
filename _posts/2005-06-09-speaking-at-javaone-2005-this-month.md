I will be co-presenting 2 sessions at [JavaOne](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/index.jsp) later this month. Here is the relevant information (edited from the [session catalog](http://www.cplan.com/javaone2005/contentcatalog) at the JavaOne website):  

**Session ID:** TS-3556  
**Session Title:** Multiple Platforms, Single Identity: Interoperable identity  
**Session Abstract:** Single sign-on between an enterprise’s web-based resources, such as applications based on Java™ 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE™ platform) and .NET, has existed in proprietary form for some time. The need to allow access across enterprise boundaries prompted the development of standards, such as SAML and Liberty ID-FF for identity federation, providing capabilities such as single sign-on and account linking across enterprise boundaries.  
This session provides a brief overview of the standards for identity federation, shows how to integrate SAML and Liberty ID-FF with J2EE platform Security, and explains how Java technology-based access management products, such as [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml), can provide interfaces even into a .NET infrastructure such as Active Directory.  
**Session Topic:** [Interoperability (Java™ Technology and .NET)](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/interoperability.jsp)  
**Session Type:** Advanced How-Tos  
**Speaker/s & Speaker/s Company:** [Eve Maler](http://www.xmlgrrl.com/), Sun Microsystems, Inc.; Pat Patterson, Sun Microsystems, Inc.  
**Date:** Wednesday June 29 2005  
**Time:** 1:30pm  
**Location:** Yerba Buena  

**Session ID:** TS-3269  
**Session Title:** Developing and Deploying Secure Identity Web Services in a Federated Environment  
**Session Abstract:** The [Liberty Alliance Project](http://www.projectliberty.org/) (LAP) defines specifications to address cross business web single sign-on (ID-FF) and provides a framework for building web services (ID-WSF). These specifications are by far the most comprehensive security framework available today to build secure identity-enabled web services. ID-WSF addresses the need to build interoperable, identity-based, identity-consuming, and standard web services.  
This session focuses on developing client- and server-side components of a secure identity web service based on Liberty ID-WSF specifications and deploying them in a Liberty-enabled environment. This session covers several Java™ standard technologies: Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE™ platform), XML parsing, JAX-RPC, XML digital signing and encryption, and others, such as Liberty Java APIs built on top of SAML and WS-Security.  
**Session Topic:** Core Enterprise (J2EE™ Technology)  
**Session Type:** Advanced How-Tos  
**Speaker/s & Speaker/s Company:** Srividhya Narayanan, Sun Microsystems, Inc.; Malla Simhachalam, Sun Microsystems, Inc.; Pat Patterson, Sun Microsystems, Inc.  
**Date:** Thursday June 30 2005  
**Time:** 12:00pm  
**Location:** Hall E134  

So - come along and find out the latest about getting your J2EE infrastructure interoperating with AD and .NET, and implementing ID-WSF web service providers and consumers in Java.
