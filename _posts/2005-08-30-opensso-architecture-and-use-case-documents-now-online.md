The first documents have gone online at [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/). Quoting from [the announcement](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=2640):

> The high-level System Architecture and Use Cases documents for OpenSSO project are now available in the documents section of the project web site. These documents are placed under the folder /opensso/docs/system folder and can be accessed as follows:
> 
> 1.  Go to the project home page at [https://opensso.dev.java.net/](https://opensso.dev.java.net/)
> 2.  Click on the "Documents & files" link in the left navigation menu.
> 3.  Navigate to the folder /opensso/docs/system
> 
> Once there, you can access these documents by clicking on the file name links for architecture and usecases.
