[I joined the developer evangelism team at Salesforce](moving-on-from-huawei) in October 2010, nearly five and a half years ago. It's been a fantastic run, but it's time for me to move on, and today will be my last day with Salesforce. Over the past few years I've worked with Apex, Visualforce, the Force.com APIs, Heroku, Salesforce Identity and, most recently, the Internet of Things, but, more than any of the technologies, it's the _people_ that have made Salesforce special for me. I've worked with the [best developer marketing team in the industry](https://developer.salesforce.com/), and the [most awesome community of admins and developers](https://success.salesforce.com/). So, what next? Starting on Monday I'll be 'Community Champion' at [StreamSets](https://streamsets.com/), a San Francisco-based startup focused on open source big data ingest. I'll be blogging at their [Continuous Ingest Blog](https://streamsets.com/blog/), speaking at conferences (including [GlueCon](http://gluecon.com/), coming up in May), [tweeting](https://twitter.com/metadaddy), and learning all about this 'big data' thing I keep hearing about. Thank you, Salesforce, for my #dreamjob, and all the fun times over the years. It's been a blast!
