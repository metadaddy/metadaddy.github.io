[As you might have just read](http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/news_events/press_releases/liberty_alliance_announces_first_companies_to_pass_full_matrix_saml_2_0_interoperability_testing), [Liberty Alliance](http://www.projectliberty.org/) recently completed its first 'full matrix' [SAML 2.0](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security#samlv20) interoperability test. Not only was Sun amongst the successful participants with its upcoming Federated Access Manager 8.0 product, we were the _only_ participant to successfully test _every_ conformance mode. [Daniel](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/), of course, [beat me to the punch on this one](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/libarty_alliance_saml_2_0), though I like to think my entry is laid out a little more neatly ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)

I'll also take this opportunity to point out that, although Federated Access Manager 8.0 is scheduled for release next year, you can get the code and binaries right now via the [OpenSSO](http://opensso.dev.java.net/) project - in fact, we just released '[build 2](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/opensso_build_2_available)' of OpenSSO v1, which includes the tested code.
