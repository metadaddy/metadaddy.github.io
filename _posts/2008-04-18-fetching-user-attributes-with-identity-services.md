As [I just blogged](http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/fetching_user_attributes_with_identity) over at [The Aquarium](http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/), [Aravindan](http://blogs.sun.com/aravind/), Lakshman and [Marina](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) just published part 3 of their series on the new identity services functionality available now in [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) and coming soon in [Sun Federated Access Manager 8.0](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/federated_access_manager_roadmap): [Securing Applications With Identity Services, Part 3: User Attributes](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/id-svcs3.html).

User attributes are key for delivering personalized services, and are often the main reason for authenticating the user in the first place. Go [read the article](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/id-svcs3.html) - whether you're a [RESTafarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) or on the [SOAPy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) side - you can quickly and easily put OpenSSO's identity services to work.
