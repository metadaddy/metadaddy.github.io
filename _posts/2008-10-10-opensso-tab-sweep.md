By now, you're probably familiar with the term 'tab sweep', particularly if you've read either of [Tim](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/) or [Rich](http://blog.softwhere.org/)'s blogs. You end the week with a bunch of tabs open in your browser that you need to blog about, so you do. Here's my first...

*   First up, [Rajeev's Blog](http://blogs.sun.com/rangal/). There's some great stuff there from the past few weeks - my favourites are [How to Integrate OpenSSO with Salesforce.com via SAML](http://blogs.sun.com/rangal/entry/saleforce_com_spring_08_has) and the [OpenSSO QuickStart prototype](http://blogs.sun.com/rangal/entry/opensso_webstart_prototype). If you have any interest at all in [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org), you need to [subscribe to Rajeev](http://blogs.sun.com/rangal/feed/entries/atom) (or to [Planet OpenSSO](http://planet.opensso.org), which aggregates Rajeev's Blog with a whole host of others).
*   Next is the [transcript from last week's OpenSSO 'Ask The Experts' session](http://java.sun.com/developer/community/askxprt/sessions/2008/jl0929.jsp) at the [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/). There's some great stuff in there - from the scheduled release date for [OpenSSO Enterprise](http://www.sun.com/software/products/opensso_enterprise/index.xml) 8.0 (October 31st) to some low level detail on configuring [OpenLDAP](http://www.openldap.org/) as a user store for OpenSSO.
*   While we're over at Sun Developer Network, [Sidharth](http://blogs.sun.com/sid/) and [Marina](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) have an article on [Deploying OpenSSO on GlassFish Application Server](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/opensso-glassfish.html) - great stuff for folks picking up OpenSSO for the first time, with handy tips for established OpenSSO fans too - some very neat command line alternatives for configuring [GlassFish](http://glassfish.org/) and deploying the OpenSSO WAR file.

There - I feel lighter now I got all that off my chest. Have a good weekend, everyone!
