Last year, Pirasenna Velandai Thiyagarajan (Piras to his friends) and I co-presented a [webinar](http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/javatools/jsenterprise/reference/presentations/sso.html) titled 'Federated Identity, Access Control, and Single Sign-On'. The webinar covered

*   - the basics of single sign-on and access control in the enterprise
*   - a simple example of SAML cross domain single sign on, with code samples
*   - a more complex example of identity aware web services using the Liberty Web Services Framework (WSF)

If you're wondering what I sound like, click the link above to find out.  

Piras and I later teamed up with Marina Sum to write a [technical article](http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/identserver/reference/techart/federated.html) on the same topic.  

These are great resources for anyone getting to grips with SSO and federation - but then, I would say that, wouldn't I :-)  

Look out for another technical article later this year, showing step-by-step how WSF can identity-enable a simple web service.
