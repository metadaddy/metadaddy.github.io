[![](http://www.projectliberty.org/design/liberty/images/libertylogo.jpg){: .align-left}](http://www.projectliberty.org/) Following on from last months [entry on Liberty Adoption](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=project_liberty_adoption_wow), the good people at the [Liberty Alliance Project](http://www.projectliberty.org/) have published the first in a quarterly series of newsletters on the topic: [Liberty Alliance Project Global Adoption Newsletter, Edition One](http://www.projectliberty.org/resources/newsletters/Liberty_Exec_Newsletter_Edition_1.pdf). It's actually a pretty good read, with John Butare and Michael Hatten of Intel's Information Services and Technology Group answering questions on their company's deployment of Liberty, a case study of BIPAC's use of federation (I've written about [how BIPAC use Sun's identity management products and the fact that this is Sun's first Liberty deployment previously](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat?entry=sun_eats_its_own_liberty)) and a detailed look at adoption in the eGovernment (e-government? egovernment?) sector. All this and not a telco (or car rental company!) in sight ![](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/images/smileys/wink.gif)
