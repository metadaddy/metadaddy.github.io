Sorry - suckered you in with that serious sounding title. Huge thanks to [Good Morning Silicon Valley](http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/gmsv/) at [SiliconValley.com](http://www.siliconvalley.com/) for posting the link to [The Credit Card Prank](http://www.zug.com/pranks/credit_card/). It had me laughing out loud. But seriously, it does prove the point that credentials only matter _if you check them_.
