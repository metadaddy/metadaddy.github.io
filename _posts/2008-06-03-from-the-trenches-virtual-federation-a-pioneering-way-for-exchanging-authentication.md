The [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/)'s [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/) spent some time recently talking to my fellow Federated Access Manager architect [Rajeev Angal](http://blogs.sun.com/rangal) about [Virtual Federation](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/virtualfederation.html), a new feature forthcoming in [Sun Federated Access Manager 8.0](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/federated_access_manager_roadmap) (but available now, of course, in [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/)). Virtual Federation promises to simplify federation by allowing legacy applications to interact across enterprise boundaries via a SAML 'tunnel'.

[Read the interview](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/virtualfederation.html) for an overview of Virtual Federation; [this article has the gory details under the old name 'Secure Attribute Exchange'](https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/use/docs/opensso/html/sae.html).
