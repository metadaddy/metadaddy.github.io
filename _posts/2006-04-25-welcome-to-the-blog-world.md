You have to imagine the title in a [Morpheus](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000401/) voice. Anyway - welcome, [Eric Leach](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/cericleach), to the blogosphere. I guess this is going to turn into another 'great people I work with at Sun' post now ![](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/images/smileys/smile.gif)

[![](http://photos.sun.com/thumbnail/400/400/4266)](http://photos.sun.com/thumbnail/400/400/4266) Eric is Product Line Manager for Federated Identity Management here at Sun, which kind of sounds like a tongue twister, but it is his real job, honest. Eric takes the customer requirements, engineering's hare-brained schemes, the specifications and standards appearing from various august (or not) bodies and, somehow, magically, orchestrates the production of [Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml), [Federation Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/federation_mgr/index.xml) and [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/).

Yup - [Eric](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/cericleach) is just about the busiest guy I know. Go read his thoughts, and leave lots of comments. Eric really needs the notification email to fill out his inbox. Honest ![](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/images/smileys/devil.gif)
