If you're a regular user of [Planet Identity](http://planetidentity.org/), you might have noticed that it has been exhibiting less than 'five nines' reliability these past few days. [Steve Lau](http://whacked.net/), who kindly hosts Planet Identity on [Grommit](http://grommit.com), migrated Grommit from Linux to Solaris 10\. There were a couple of hiccups along the way, but it looks like normal service has been resumed.  
**UPDATED** Corrected migration from 'Linux to Apache' to 'Linux to Solaris 10' - thanks, Geoff!
