Following up to my [recent post](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat/20050205#lingo_voip) on Lingo VOIP, [Tom's Networking](http://www.tomsnetworking.com/) has an [interesting review](http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Reviews-188-ProdID-WRT54GP2.php) of the [Linksys](http://www.linksys.com/) [WRT54GP2](http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=657&scid=35) VOIP/wireless/broadband router. I've been a happy user of the [WRT54G](http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&scid=35&prid=601) for a couple of years now, so this box looks very interesting - it can prioritize VOIP traffic over data traffic just like the standard Lingo adapter, solving my only issue with [Lingo](http://www.lingo.com/).  
All I have to do now is persuade Lingo to support it.
