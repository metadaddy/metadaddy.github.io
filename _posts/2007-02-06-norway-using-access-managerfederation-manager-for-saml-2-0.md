It being [RSA](http://www.rsaconference.com/2007/us/) week, the news comes thick and fast... I've just seen the [press release](http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/070206/sftu061.html?.v=91) announcing that the [Government of Norway](http://www.norway.no/) has deployed a whole slew of Sun hardware and software, including [Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/) and [Federation Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/federation_mgr/), for its pioneering citizen portal, [MinSide](http://www.norway.no/minside/) (English translation: MyPage). Quoting from the press release:

> [...] the MinSide [MyPage] portal will roll-out six initiatives that will enable secure, browser-based access to healthcare, tax, motor vehicle registration, social security, student loans and many other government services.

...and...

> As part of the solution, Sun Java(TM) System Access Manager and Sun Java(TM) Federation Manager help the Norwegian government manage secure access to services by offering single sign-on (SSO) as well as enabling federation across trusted networks of government agencies, service providers and customers. It provides open, standards-based authentication and policy-based authorization with a single, unified framework. This improved security framework is based on the Liberty and SAML standards to protect all aspects of the portal.

The [Liberty Alliance website](http://projectliberty.org/) has a [presentation by Dag Efjestad](http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/files/presentations/oslo_norway_dag) that gives much more detail. Cool stuff, Norway - [douze points!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest)
