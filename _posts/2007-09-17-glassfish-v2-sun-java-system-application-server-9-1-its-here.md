[As you've almost certainly already noticed](http://blogs.sun.com/main/tags/glassfishv2), [Glassfish](https://glassfish.dev.java.net/) turned [v2](http://wiki.glassfish.java.net/Wiki.jsp?page=PlanForGlassFishV2) today, with commercial support available from Sun in the form of [Sun Java System Application Server 9.1](http://www.sun.com/software/products/appsrvr/appsrvr9_1.xml). New features target the enterprise, with clustering support, improved performance and, arguably most interesting, web services support from [Metro](http://metro.dev.java.net/). We're building [OpenSSO](http://opensso.dev.java.net/)'s WS-Trust security token service (STS) on Metro.

OpenSSO and [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/) have supported GFv2 and AS 9.1 for some time now both as a deployment container (recall, OpenSSO/Access Manager is a standard J2EE web application) and via a Java EE policy agent - [available here in source form](https://opensso.dev.java.net/source/browse/opensso/products/j2eeagents/) and [here as a supported policy agent](http://www.sun.com/download/products.xml?id=46d7aa66) for Access Manager. It's also worth pointing out that Access Manager ships with the [NetBeans Enterprise Pack](http://www.netbeans.org/products/enterprise/) - [NetBeans](http://www.netbeans.org/), Glassfish, Access Manager and much, much more in one hit. Heady stuff!
