I just finished reading [The Truth About Federated Identity Management](http://www.csoonline.com/read/100106/fea_federated_idm.html) by [Sarah D. Scalet](http://www.csoonline.com/staff/sscalet.html) at [CSO](http://www.csoonline.com/). It's a good read, focussing on the importance of the business case in deploying federated identity and the fact that 80% of the work in any federation deployment is on the business side. The technology, by comparison, pretty much "just works". Make sure you hit the sidebar too: [Thinking of Doing Federated Identity Management?](http://www.csoonline.com/read/100106/fea_federated_idm_sidebar.html).
