As [Daniel](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/) [just blogged](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/opensso_community_perk_20_discount), attendees at our [second OpenSSO Community Day](http://www.meetup.com/opensso/calendar/9690413/), to be held at the [Deutsches Museum](http://www.nfadm.de/) in Munich on May 5 2009, can get a 20% discount off their registration for the [European Identity Conference 2009](https://www.id-conf.com/eic2009), which is kindly hosting us during their conference week. Just quote **OPENSSO** when you register and you'll get the discount. As Daniel says "_We will be passing an attendance list to Kuppinger-Cole so you need to show-up to our community day to get this discount_".

Meanwhile, looking at our [first OpenSSO Community Day](http://www.meetup.com/opensso/calendar/9588430/), in New York City, on March 17 (yes, St Patrick's Day; no, that wasn't intentional - honest!) [we blew past our original estimate of one man and a dog](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/opensso_community_day_super_sized) and had to move it to a bigger room. We're now in the [Shorin Performance Studio](http://www.nyu.edu/kimmel.center/images/rooms/shorin.jpg) on the 8th floor of the [Kimmel Center](http://www.nyu.edu/kimmel.center/index.html).

Currently leading in the unofficial "furthest travelled attendee" contest for New York looks to be [Kimimasa](http://blogs.sun.com/kimimasa/), flying in from Japan. Can anyone beat that? [Any OpenSSO community members in Perth, Australia?](http://www.antipodr.com/?addr=New+York%2C+NY&x=0&y=0)
