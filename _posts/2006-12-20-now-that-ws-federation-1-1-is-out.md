[[WS-Federation 1.1]](http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/dw/specs/ws-fed/WS-Federation-V1-1B.pdf), when are [thought](http://blogs.sun.com/hubertsblog/entry/ws_federation_version_1_1) [leaders](http://beuchelt.blogdns.net:8080/WSDederation11DejaVu.aspx) at vendors like Sun going to come clean and mention this in their blogs. Their silence is suspicious! This is clearly going to become the [industry](http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty_interoperable/interoperable_products/saml_2_0_v1_0_interoperable_product_table) [standard](http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty_interoperable/interoperable_products/saml_2_0_v2_0_interoperable_product_table) for federated single sign-on, despite anything [those bozos at OASIS](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security) say.
