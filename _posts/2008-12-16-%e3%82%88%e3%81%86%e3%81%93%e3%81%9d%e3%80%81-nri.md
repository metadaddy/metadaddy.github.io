From Japan, news that [Nomura Research Institute](http://www.nri.co.jp/english/index.html) (NRI), a consulting and IT solution services company spun off from [Nomura Securities](http://www.nomura.com/), are offering [support and services for OpenSSO [Japanese press release]](http://www.nri.co.jp/news/2008/081210.html) [[Google translation to English]](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nri.co.jp%2Fnews%2F2008%2F081210.html&sl=ja&tl=en&history_state0=), including OpenID for cross-enterprise authentication.

As well as being a big endorsement for [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/), this event marks its graduation as an open source project - it's definitely no longer 'just a Sun thing'.

Welcome, NRI! We look forward to your contributions to OpenSSO!
