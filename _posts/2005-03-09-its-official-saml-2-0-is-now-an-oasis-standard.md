[Announced today](http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/tc-announce/200503/msg00003.html) on the OASIS tc-accounce list. A consolidated zip file with all specifications and schema is [publicly available](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/11045/sstc-saml-2.0-cd-04-pdf-xsd.zip). See the [OASIS SAML site](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security#samlv20) for individual PDFs, XSDs, etc.  
Briefly, SAML 2.0 unifies the previous disparate federated identity building blocks of SAML 1.1 with input from both higher education's Shibboleth initiative and the Liberty Alliance's Identity Federation Framework. There is an [executive overview](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/9886/sstc-saml-exec-overview-2.0-draft-02.pdf) of SAML 2.0 that summarizes what's new.
