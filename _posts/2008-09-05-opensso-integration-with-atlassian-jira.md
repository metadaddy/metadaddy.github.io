Alexey Abashev, a Sun ISV engineer in Moscow, Russia, [sent an email](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=users&msgNo=3997) to the [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) [users mailing list](https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList) a few weeks ago, announcing his [Atlassian Jira](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/) extension for OpenSSO. The [plugin page](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAEXT/Sun+Access+Manager+(OpenSSO)+Integration) details how to deploy the extension and enable single sign-on to Jira via OpenSSO. Cool stuff!

I haven't had a chance to try this yet, but, if you have, [let me know in the comments](http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/entry/opensso_integration_with_atlassian_jira#comments) how you got on...
