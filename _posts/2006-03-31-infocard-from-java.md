[![](http://xmldap.org/relyingparty/img/card.png){: .align-left}](https://xmldap.org/relyingparty/) Kudos to [Chuck](http://xmldap.blogspot.com/) for [implementing an Infocard RP in Java](http://xmldap.blogspot.com/2006/03/simple-java-based-relying-party.html) - and not only an RP, but [online Infocard generation as well](http://xmldap.blogspot.com/2006/03/make-your-own-security-tokens-without.html). So - the next piece of the puzzle - what _is_ that symmetric proof key in the SAML assertion for??? If you know, then please put us out of our misery, either here or at [Chuck's post on the topic](http://xmldap.blogspot.com/2006/03/how-to-consume-tokens-from-infocard.html).
