Funny how things turn out, after over three years of work ([OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) was [announced on July 13, 2005](http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2005-07/sunflash.20050713.3.xml)), we end up releasing three days early (November 11 2008 rather than the planned November 14 2008)... Still, OpenSSO Enterprise 8.0 is now officially DONE:

Although Eve's post focuses on SAML news, the OpenSSO Enterprise 8.0 release is in there due to its _"uniquely solid row of SAML2 [interop certifications](http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/liberty_interoperable/implementations/saml_2_0_test_procedure_v3_0_full_matrix_implementation_table_q407)."_

So... What's next for OpenSSO? Well, coming up we have carrier-grade monitoring, more ease-of-use work, task flows for SaaS federation (think Google and Salesforce.com federation setup with the absolute minimum number of clicks) and entitlement management. Oh, and Express Build 7 will be coming up in about 3 months, too. Fun times... :-)
