Thanks to my very good friend Brian Schussler for getting me into Adobe's San Jose offices yesterday to watch the [San Jose Grand Prix](http://www.sanjosegrandprix.com/) from the air conditioned splendour of a 2nd floor conference room. Here are some pics from the event:

The view south along Almaden Boulevard. I _think_ that's Rodolfo Lavin.

Following the pace car during one of the numerous yellow flags - Sebastien Bourdais leading Paul Tracy.  

Unfortunately, at this point I was out of space on my camera _and_ out of battery. That's life...
