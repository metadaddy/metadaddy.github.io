Completing our trilogy of articles on integrating [Sun Java System Access Manager](http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/) with Microsoft web applications is [Sun and Microsoft Interoperate for Web Authentication, Part 3 - Sun Java System Access Manager and Microsoft Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server 2003](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/owa.html). This time, [Marina Sum](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/marinasum/), our resident technical author, and Madan Ranganath, Access Manager policy agent engineer, focus on single sign-on from Access Manager to [OWA 2003](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa996808.aspx).

If you work your way through the first two installments, covering [IIS](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/interoperability.html) and [SharePoint Portal Server 2003](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/sharepoint.html), and [this final article](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/owa.html), you'll know pretty much all there is to know about single sign-on between Access Manager and Microsoft's web applications.
