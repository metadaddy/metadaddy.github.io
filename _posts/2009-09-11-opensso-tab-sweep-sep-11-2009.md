Wow - it's been _months_ since [the last OpenSSO tab sweep](http://blog.superpat.com/2009/09/11/opensso-tab-sweep-sep-11-2009/). Anyway - here's a collection of the latest news from the world of [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/):

*   [Sun Developer Network](http://developers.sun.com/) continues to publish excellent articles on OpenSSO. Last month, Rick Palkovic of SDN and Francois Lascelles of [Layer 7 Techologies](http://www.layer7tech.com/) collaborated on [Delegating XML Gateway Runtime Authorization to OpenSSO](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/xmlgatewayopensso.html), showing how Layer 7's [SecureSpan XML Networking Gateway](http://www.layer7tech.com/main/products/xml-networking-gateway.html) integrates with OpenSSO to provide edge security for SOA, Web 2.0 and cloud-based web services.
*   This month, Rick's written another article, this time with Qingwen Cheng and [Mrudul Uchil](http://blogs.sun.com/mrudul/) of Sun's OpenSSO engineering team. [Enabling IP/Resource/Environment Based Authentication With OpenSSO](http://developers.sun.com/identity/reference/techart/ipresenvauthopensso.html) is a three-part series explaining how this functionality, new in [OpenSSO Express Build 8](http://blog.superpat.com/2009/09/04/opensso-express-build-8-released/), replaces the pre-existing Gateway servlet to provide a flexible mechanism for including contextual information in the authentication process.
*   My colleague, [Hubert Le Van Gong](http://bug4free.wordpress.com/) has been blogging profusely over the past few weeks on the topic of [OpenID 2.0 and OpenSSO](http://bug4free.wordpress.com/tag/openid/). As Hubert mentions, we recently rewrote the [OpenSSO OpenID extension](https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/extensions/openid/) to support OpenID 2.0\. Hubert's blog entries cover a number of topics specific to the rewrite, including [deployment](http://bug4free.wordpress.com/2009/08/24/openid2-o-opensso/) (with an important [follow up](http://bug4free.wordpress.com/2009/09/01/follow-up-deploying-the-openid2-0-extension-for-opensso/)) and [realm/relying party validation](http://bug4free.wordpress.com/2009/09/07/realm-and-rp-validation/). [C'est la Vie](http://bug4free.wordpress.com/) is definitely a blog worth watching if you're interested in the OpenID/OpenSSO intersection.
*   There have been a number of OpenSSO policy agent releases over the past few weeks, including agents for Apache 2.2 and IIS 7\. The [OpenSSO Policy Agents 3.0 Roadmap](http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSSO/OpenSSO+Policy+Agents+3.0+Roadmap) is the place to stay up to date.
*   The replay of [Daniel](http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/)'s [OpenSSO webinar from last month](http://blog.superpat.com/2009/08/18/free-webinar-opensso-express-for-improved-sso/), which, by the way, set an internal record for registrations, has been posted online. [Click here to catch up](https://slx.sun.com/node/1179275271/).
*   Outside Sun, '[Pairg](http://pairg.hu/)' has released a [WordPress plugin for OpenSSO authentication](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/opensso-plugin/) (thanks, [Ramoonus](http://www.ramoonus.nl/), for the tip!). It looks to have much more functionality than the [proof of concept code I released a little while ago](http://blog.superpat.com/2009/07/27/opensso-single-sign-on-plugin-for-wordpress/), so, if you're into WordPress, I recommend you go take a look.

Now I can close a few Firefox tabs and relax. Have a good weekend, everyone!
