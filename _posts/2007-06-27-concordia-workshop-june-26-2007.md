Well, I was going to type up my notes from the [Project Concordia](http://projectconcordia.org/index.php/Main_Page) workshop yesterday, but it looks like the two Marks ([Dixon](http://blogs.sun.com/identity/entry/concordia_project_making_identity_federation) and [Wahl](http://www.ldap.com/1/commentary/wahl/20070626_01.shtml)) comprehensively beat me to the punch. Much good stuff, particularly the [GSA eAuthentication](http://www.gsa.gov/e-authentication) presentation, which detailed the issues involved in rolling out federation across the Federal Government. It was also refreshing to see folks from [Microsoft](http://cardspace.netfx3.com/) and the [OpenID](http://openid.net/) and [Liberty Alliance](http://projectliberty.org/) communities engaging most constructively. Seems like Concordia was [appropriately named](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordia_%28mythology%29).
