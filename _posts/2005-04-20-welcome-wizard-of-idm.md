[![](images/DonAtSunNetwork_tn.jpg){: .align-left}](images/DonAtSunNetwork.jpg)I've [ written here before](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/superpat/20050323#sun_java_system_directory_server) about my good friend Don Bowen, product line manager for [ Sun Java System Directory Server](http://www.sun.com/software/products/directory_srvr_ee/index.xml). Well, Don is joining us in the blogosphere with [ Wizard of IdM](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/wizidm), which promises to be required reading for anyone working in identity management.  
Welcome, Don!
