If you're in the Chicago area next week you might be interested in attending the [Chicago Java Users Group (CJUG)](http://www.cjug.org/) meeting on Tuesday (June 16 2009) - [Kiran Ramineni](http://www.cjug.org/Wiki.jsp?page=KiranRamineni), Principal at [Ramp Info](http://www.rampinfo.com/), will be presenting on [OpenSSO and Identity Federation](http://www.cjug.org/Wiki.jsp?page=2009.06.16.downtown). The event starts at [6pm in the Lewis Towers Ballroom, Beane Hall at Loyola University of Chicago](http://www.cjug.org/Wiki.jsp?page=2009.06.16.downtown), and is free to CJUG members and first time guests. Sounds like a bargain to me, so get yourself down there next Tuesday night and then [leave a comment here](http://blog.superpat.com/2009/06/12/opensso-and-identity-federation-in-downtown-chicago/#respond) to let us know how it went!
