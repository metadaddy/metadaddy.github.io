If you're wondering where I've been lately, I was holed up preparing our [interoperability demo](https://identity.planetinterop.org:3621/opensso/concordia.jsp) for the [Project Concordia workshop at RSA 2008](http://projectconcordia.org/index.php/Concordia_workshop_RSA_2008_notes) today, showing SAML 2.0/WS-Federation single sign-on from a service provider to an identity provider, the identity provider authenticating the user via a managed information card and sending claims from the card to the service provider as SAML 2.0 attributes. Note - if you clicking around there, not _every_ combination of SAML 2.0/WS-Federation SP, IdP and Information Card STS _completely_ works, but enough that the approach was proven. As promised, [Here are the slides from my presentation today](http://blog.superpat.com/ConcordiaRSA0408.pdf).

So... Tomorrow and Wednesday are [OSIS](http://osis.idcommons.net/wiki/Main_Page) [I3 Interop](http://osis.idcommons.net/wiki/I3_User-Centric_Identity_Interop_through_RSA_2008), in [Purple Room 220/222](http://www.rsaconference.com/2008/US/Highlights_and_Events/Interoperability_Demonstrations.aspx). Come along, say hi and check out how we're doing on [those interoperability matrices](http://osis.idcommons.net/wiki/I3:Overall_Results)...
