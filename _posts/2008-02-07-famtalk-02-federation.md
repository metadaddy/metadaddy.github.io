I just uploaded the second [FAMTalk](http://famtalk.org/) podcast - this time, I have the host's seat, presenting 'Federation', with a particular focus on SAML 2.0\. You can download a PDF plus MP3 or AAC files from [FAMTalk.org](http://famtalk.org/), or simply [subscribe to FAMTalk via iTunes](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=270422627) or [RSS](http://www.famtalk.org/rss.xml).

We had some frustrating technical problems recording this episode - the Sony USB headset (UAB-260) I was using developed an annoying crackle about halfway through the program. Unplugging, replugging, rebooting - nothing made it work for more than a few minutes at a time. After wrestling with it for an hour, we decided to just record the outro segment together and I ordered a [Griffin iMic](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/imic) to replace the Sony USB Audio box (the headset itself seemed ok) to fill in the gap on my own.

The funny thing was, I got a bit of a cold between the first recording and the second, so the transitions between the different segments are quite obvious - you can hear me get sick and recover, all within an hour ![](http://blogs.sun.com/images/smileys/smile.gif)
