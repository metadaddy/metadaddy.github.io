I just established an IRC channel for [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net) on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) - [#opensso](irc://irc.freenode.net/%23opensso). The idea is that this will server as a 'virtual watercooler' - a venue for informal chat on any topic connected to OpenSSO. It will probably take a few days to get going, but, it should soon become a useful venue for anyone using or developing OpenSSO.

Fire up your IRC client and I'll [see you there](irc://irc.freenode.net/%23opensso)! :-)

_UPDATE -_ btw - if you see 'metadaddy' on the IRC channel - that would be me.
