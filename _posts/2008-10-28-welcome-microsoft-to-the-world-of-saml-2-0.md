This is a blog entry I've been wanting to write for [a LONG time](http://blog.superpat.com/2005/12/08/update-on-ws-federation-saml-2-0/)... At the Professional Developers Conference today, Microsoft announced that 'Geneva', their forthcoming identity platform (part of which is the successor to Active Directory Federation Services), will not only support [SAML 2.0](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/security/) as a token format, but also as a single sign-on protocol. The Federation Wars are over!!!

Lots more to read on the subject:

*   [Don Schmidt: Microsoft “Geneva” Server Supports SAML 2.0](http://identity-des.com/2008/10/28/microsoft-geneva-server-supports-saml-20/)
*   [Mike Jones: Next News from the PDC: SAML 2.0 Protocol Support in “Geneva” Server](http://self-issued.info/?p=90)
*   [Network World: Microsoft to unveil tools to push identity platform into the cloud](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/102708-microsoft-identity-cloud.html)

Me, I'm looking forward to testing [OpenSSO](http://opensso.org/) with Geneva. We live in interesting times indeed :-)
