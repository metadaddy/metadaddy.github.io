I know - I should have posted this a week ago, but... better late than never. Kevin LeMay (Senior Technical Marketing Manager, Directory Server Enterprise Edition), Chris LaPoint (Senior Product Manager, Identity Manager) and I will be online, live, tomorrow from 10:00am - 11:00am Pacific, answering questions on Sun's Identity Management product line. Register [here](http://www.sun.com/expertexchange) and login tomorrow morning, afternoon, evening, or whatever time of day it is where you are, and fire away!
