Normal blogging service was disrupted somewhat by last week's [DIDW](http://conference.digitalidworld.com/2006/) and [IOS](http://ios.windley.com/wiki/IOSSantaClara). Among many snippets in my 'to blog' pile, here are links to a couple of recent 'hands-on' articles from Sun's [BigAdmin](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/) site:

*   [Installing, Managing, and Using Sun Java System Access Manager and Sun Java System Identity Manager on the Solaris 10 OS](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/install_id_mgr.html) - _[Jonathan Gershater](http://blogs.sun.com/jo/), Suveer Chainani, Abdi Mohammadi, Jan Vanhaecht_ - exactly what it says on the tin - full of Solaris 10 zonal goodness.
*   [Single Sign-On Using Sun Java System Access Manager 2005Q4 and Sun Java System Access Manager Policy Agent 2.2](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/access_manager_sso.html) - [_Manikandan Chandrasekaran_](http://blogs.sun.com/cmani) - a quick start guide for getting Access Manager and a couple of policy agents up and running.

If this sort of stuff lights your fire, then you probably want to [subscribe to the monthly BigAdmin newsletter](https://communications.sun.com/sunReg/BigAdmin/bareg.jsp).
